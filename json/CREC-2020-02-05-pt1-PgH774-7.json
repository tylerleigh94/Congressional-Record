Madam Speaker, today, I rise because there is an \nepidemic in our country. One hundred Americans die every day from gun \nviolence. We are 25 times more likely to die from guns than people who \nlive in comparable nations.\n  Gun violence is personal to me. When I was a young boy, my sister \ntook her life with my father's revolver. In 2014, my community was \ndevastated by the Isla Vista shooting that killed six people and left \n14 injured.\n  I rise because there are commonsense solutions to curb this violent \ntrend. One of those is my bipartisan Extreme Risk Protection Order Act \nof 2019, which will help ensure people who have demonstrated that they \nare at risk of hurting themselves or others temporarily don't have \naccess to guns. The bill passed out of the committee. I now ask the \nHouse to bring this legislation to the floor.\n  The House has already sent two bipartisan background check bills to \nthe Senate; yet, Senate Majority Leader McConnell has not acted. There \nis no excuse.\n  I will continue to rise until we end this epidemic.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker_bioguide": "C001112", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker": "None", "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 2}], "id": "CREC-2020-02-05-pt1-PgH774-7", "doc_title": "GUN VIOLENCE IS AN EPIDEMIC", "title": "GUN VIOLENCE IS AN EPIDEMIC"}
