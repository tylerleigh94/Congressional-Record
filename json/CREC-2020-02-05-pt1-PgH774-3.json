Madam Speaker, I rise today to welcome Rabbi Seth \nFrisch, who delivered today's opening prayer to the people's House.\n  Since his ordination in 1986, at the Jewish Theological Seminary of \nAmerica in New York, Rabbi Frisch has been a source of comfort and \ncounsel to Jews around the world. In his current posting as rabbi and \nteacher of the New Shul of Philadelphia, Rabbi Frisch helps serve as a \nguide for those who want to learn more about what it means to be Jewish \nin a safe and supporting setting.\n  In a way, today's opening prayer was a homecoming for Rabbi Frisch, \nwho previously served as a legislative assistant to the chairman of the \nUnited States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  I pray that we will all heed his words today, that out of many, we \nare one Nation. Let us strive to put our divisions behind us and \nrealize our dream of a country indivisible with liberty and justice for \nall.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker_bioguide": "C001084", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker": "None", "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 3}], "id": "CREC-2020-02-05-pt1-PgH774-3", "doc_title": "WELCOMING RABBI SETH FRISCH", "title": "WELCOMING RABBI SETH FRISCH"}
