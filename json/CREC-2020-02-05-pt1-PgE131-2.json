Madam Speaker, I rise today in memory of Tom McKenna, \nwho passed away on December 11th after a courageous battle with two \nrare forms of leukemia at the age of 78.\n   Tom was born on August 11, 1941 in Chicago to Charles and Dorothy \nMcKenna. He was a proud south-sider, an avid Notre Dame and Chicago \nBears fan, and a passionate golfer.\n   Tom is survived by his wife Karin of 36 years, daughter Mary Kate \nBattles, son Matt McKenna, grandson Max Battles, son-in-law Joseph \nBattles, daughter-in-law Maggie Shine as well as his brothers Chuck, \nDan and Jim, and many nieces and nephews. He also leaves behind many \ndear, wonderful golfing friends at Sand Creek Country Club and the many \nwork friends he made over his 40-year career in the steel industry.\n   Tom will be remembered for being a fiercely loyal companion, father, \ngrandfather and friend, and for his positive outlook on life. ``Every \nday is a good day'' was a phrase he said each day, which is a memory \nthat will continue to inspire everyone who knew him.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker_bioguide": "S001215", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker": "None", "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 4}], "id": "CREC-2020-02-05-pt1-PgE131-2", "doc_title": "REMEMBERING THOMAS J.
