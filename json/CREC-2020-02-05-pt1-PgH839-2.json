Madam Speaker, our emerging Nation sought to be a \nbright light for democracy and the rule of law. This afternoon, I sat \nin the Senate Chamber and watched the Senate one by one announce the \nwords guilty or not guilty: Article I, guilty 48, not guilty 52; \nArticle II, guilty 47, not guilty 53.\n  I believe the presentation of the Judiciary, Oversight, Intelligence, \nand Foreign Affairs Committees was brilliantly presented.\n  I wondered whether there would be one moment for a profile in \ncourage, one understanding that the norm of this Nation cannot tolerate \nwhat the Framers were most frightened about, which was the \nconstitutional crime of abuse of power or having a sovereign nation \ninterfere with our elections. Yet, there was one in Article I that made \nit bipartisan in the guilt, but no one in Article II.\n  Simply stated, now what is the answer? That this Nation no longer \nloves its democracy; does not stand by the rule of law; and, therefore, \nthe person who remains in office is a king?\n  I believe, Madam Speaker, that we must raise the Constitution and \nfight for justice.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker_bioguide": "J000032", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker": "None", "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 2}], "id": "CREC-2020-02-05-pt1-PgH839-2", "doc_title": "FIGHT FOR JUSTICE", "title": "FIGHT FOR JUSTICE"}
