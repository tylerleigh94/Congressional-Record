Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize National Gun Violence \nSurvivors Week and the countless Americans whose lives have been \nimpacted by gun violence across the country.\n  This issue is personal to me, as it is for so many others. When I was \n16 years old, as a young police cadet, an accidental gunshot left me \nparalyzed.\n  Last week, I had the honor of spending time with former Congresswoman \nGabby Giffords, our colleague, in my home State of Rhode Island. \nGabby's life was forever changed by a gunman in 2011, but she never \nstopped fighting. She spoke of the courage it takes to stop gun \nviolence, courage that she embodies every single day.\n  So, to the parents, children, students, teachers, and countless \nothers who have lost loved ones to gun violence or faced gun violence \nthemselves, I encourage you to keep fighting.\n  Together, we can reform our gun laws and keep guns out of the wrong \nhands and save others from tragedy.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker_bioguide": "L000559", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker": "None", "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 2}], "id": "CREC-2020-02-05-pt1-PgH836-2", "doc_title": "NATIONAL GUN VIOLENCE SURVIVORS WEEK", "title": "NATIONAL GUN VIOLENCE SURVIVORS WEEK"}
