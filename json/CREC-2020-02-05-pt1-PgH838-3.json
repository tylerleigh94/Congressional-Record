Madam Speaker, I rise today in defense of the \nAmerican healthcare system.\n  Last week, the administration proposed a new demonstration program \nthat would allow States to apply for block grants. These would permit \nStates to slash funding for their Medicaid programs, reduce protections \nfor beneficiaries, and restrict eligibility standards. A recent study \nby George Washington University found that these changes would also \nresult in community health centers treating 5 million fewer patients \nover the next 4 years.\n  This is unacceptable. Federal law already gives Medicaid flexibility \nto change from State to State. These proposed block grants are nothing \nmore than cuts to funding for the program.\n  Today, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for a resolution \ncondemning these proposed changes as what they are: attacks on our \nhealthcare system and those with preexisting conditions.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker_bioguide": "O000171", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker": "None", "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 2}], "id": "CREC-2020-02-05-pt1-PgH838-3", "doc_title": "DEFEND AMERICAN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM", "title": "DEFEND AMERICAN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM"}
