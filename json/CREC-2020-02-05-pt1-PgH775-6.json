Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Gun Violence \nSurvivors Week.\n  Every year, roughly 36,000 Americans are killed from gun violence. \nThis is an\n\n\naverage of 100 Americans every single day. Also, there are close to \n100,000 Americans injured every year from gun violence, yet we do very \nlittle to prevent these preventable injuries and deaths.\n  I am proud to come from a State with effective gun laws. In New \nJersey, we have strong background checks, a ban on high-capacity \nmagazines, and an extreme risk protection order for possible victims. \nThat is why New Jersey has one of the lowest firearm death rates in \nAmerica. If we had national laws such as the ones in New Jersey, we \ncould save lives and spare families the hurt and horrors of gun \nviolence.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker_bioguide": "P000604", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker": "None", "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 2}], "id": "CREC-2020-02-05-pt1-PgH775-6", "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING NATIONAL GUN VIOLENCE SURVIVORS WEEK", "title": "RECOGNIZING NATIONAL GUN VIOLENCE SURVIVORS WEEK"}
