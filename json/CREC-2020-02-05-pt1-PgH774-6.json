Madam Speaker, I rise today to \nrecognize and thank one of the most productive, job-producing \nconstituents in my district, Punxsutawney Phil.\n  Over the weekend, Punxsutawney Phil delivered us some good news: He \npredicted an early spring for the second year in a row.\n  But that is not the only good news. Groundhog Day draws tens of \nthousands of tourists to Jefferson County each year, which boosts \nrevenue at local restaurants, hotels, and other small businesses.\n  Last week, activists claimed that Punxsutawney Phil should be \nreplaced by an animatronic groundhog powered by artificial \nintelligence.\n  Well, I believe in creating jobs, not eliminating them. And \nPunxsutawney Phil is no exception. I will always stand up for the \nhardworking men, women, and rodents in the 15th District of \nPennsylvania.\n  In all seriousness, Groundhog Day brings together people of all \ndifferent backgrounds, and this fun family celebration reminds us of \nthe importance of tradition. It is not only an economic stimulus in the \ndistrict, but it is also a great source of pride.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker_bioguide": "T000467", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker": "None", "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 2}], "id": "CREC-2020-02-05-pt1-PgH774-6", "doc_title": "PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL", "title": "PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL"}
