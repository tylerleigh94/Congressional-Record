Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor a talented young \nlady from my district.\n  Bri Folds, a Lakeland Christian and Auburn grad, was drafted in the \nfourth round of the 2020 National Woman's Soccer League draft by the \nNorth Carolina Courage.\n  Ms. Folds is the first player from Polk County to be drafted by the \nNational Women's Soccer League. Folds was a two-time Lakeland Ledger \nPlayer of the Year, with 173 goals and 155 assists while at Lakeland \nChristian. She finished her college career ranked seventh all-time at \nAuburn in assists, eighth in goals, and tied for fifth in game-winning \ngoals with nine.\n  I am extraordinarily proud of her dedication and drive. It is \nimportant that our community continues to invest in future generations \nto produce stars and leaders like Ms. Folds. Players like her will \ninfluence young girls for years to come.\n  I encourage all of District 15 to join me in cheering on Bri Folds \nwhen the 2020 NWSL season begins in March.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker_bioguide": "S001210", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker": "None", "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 2}], "id": "CREC-2020-02-05-pt1-PgH838-6", "doc_title": "BRI FOLDS GOES PRO", "title": "BRI FOLDS GOES PRO"}
