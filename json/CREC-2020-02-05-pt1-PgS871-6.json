Last night, in the State of the Union Address, \nPresident Trump called on Congress to put bipartisan legislation to \nlower prescription drug prices on his desk and that he would sign it.\n  Here are the facts. The House is controlled by Democrats. The Senate \nrequires bipartisanship to get any legislating done. There are only a \ncouple of months left before the campaign season will likely impede \nanything from being accomplished in this Congress. So the time to act \nis right now.\n  I am calling on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get off \nthe sidelines and to work with me and Senator Wyden, as President Trump \nalready is, to heed the call to action that he gave us last night and \npass the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act. It is the only \nsignificant bipartisan bill in town. President Trump, the AARP, and the \nlibertarian Cato think tank, to name just a few people involved, have \nall endorsed the bill.\n  If you are serious about fulfilling promises to lower drug costs, my \noffice door is open, as Senator Wyden's door is open. It is time for \nthe Senate to act and to deliver for the American people.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 0, "speaker_bioguide": "G000386", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "The PRESIDING OFFICER", "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
