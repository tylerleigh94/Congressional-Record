Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and \ncongratulate Ashley Lin of Vancouver, Washington, on becoming a \ndistinguished finalist and top volunteer in the 2020 Prudential Spirit \nof Community Awards program.\n  These annual awards were founded in 1995 to highlight individuals' \nservice to our communities, and to encourage younger members of this \nnation to continue this tradition early on and throughout their lives.\n  Ashley, a junior at Union High School in Southwest Washington, \nfounded and runs the organization ``Project Exchange.'' This \norganization has been central in recruiting participants, designing \ncurriculum, and securing funding to bring cross-cultural learning \nexperiences to 250 middle and high school students from over 20 \ncountries. She attributes the motivation to create this program to her \ntime serving as a U.S. Youth Ambassador to Uruguay.\n  Once again, I want to extend my sincerest congratulations to Ashley \non becoming a distinguished finalist in this program. I also applaud \nAshley for bringing these opportunities to students from all over the \nworld, and enhancing their educational experiences.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker_bioguide": "H001056", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker": "None", "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 3}], "id": "CREC-2020-02-05-pt1-PgE132-3", "doc_title": "CONGRATULATING ASHLEY LIN ON BECOMING A DISTINGUISHED FINALIST IN THE PRUDENTIAL SPIRIT OF COMMUNITY AWARDS PROGRAM", "title": "CONGRATULATING ASHLEY LIN ON BECOMING A DISTINGUISHED FINALIST IN THE  PRUDENTIAL SPIRIT OF COMMUNITY AWARDS PROGRAM"}
