Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate \nVisit Huntington Beach on the celebration of its 30th Anniversary and \nthe opening of a new office.\n  Visit Huntington Beach was formed in 1989 as a destination marketing \nprogram and has grown into the only local organization charged with the \nresponsibility of promoting tourism and encouraging its continued \ngrowth in the City. Its mission is to use Huntington Beach's Surf City \nUSA brand to maintain the City's status as the quintessential \nCalifornia beach destination. Since its founding thirty years ago, \nVisit Huntington Beach has successfully lived up to this mission and \nshowed the wonders of Huntington Beach to the country and the world.\n  In 2018 alone, overnight visitors generated $91 million in tax \nrevenue and generated nearly $20 million for the City's general fund. \nThis revenue is vital to funding critical community services, such as \npolice, fire, public works, and parks.\n  I ask all Members to join me in recognizing the extraordinary work \nand contributions of Visit Huntington Beach and their efforts to ensure \na better and more efficient experience for both visitors and residents \nof Huntington Beach.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker_bioguide": "R000616", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker": "None", "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 3}], "id": "CREC-2020-02-05-pt1-PgE134", "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF VISIT HUNTINGTON BEACH", "title": "RECOGNIZING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF VISIT HUNTINGTON BEACH"}
