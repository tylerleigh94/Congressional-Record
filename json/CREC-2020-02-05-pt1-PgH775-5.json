Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Einar Maisch \nfor his 34 years of service to the Placer County Water Agency. Water \nresiliency and infrastructure are pressing needs in northern \nCalifornia, and Einar has devoted his career to solving these critical \nissues.\n  As general manager, he worked to make PCWA the local leader in water \nrights by overseeing the clear and transparent budget process, \nincreasing customer accessibility to the agency, and expanding its \nregional and national influence on water issues.\n  Throughout his long tenure, Einar has always prioritized the needs \nand interests of the customers and the community. His work will leave a \nlasting impact on water planning, resiliency, and management in \nnorthern California for decades come, and the north State is very \nthankful for all Einar has done.\n  Madam Speaker, I thank Einar, and I wish him the best of luck in his \nmuch-deserved and probably busier retirement. May he keep his knowledge \nand experience available to all of us.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker_bioguide": "L000578", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker": "None", "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 2}], "id": "CREC-2020-02-05-pt1-PgH775-5", "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING EINAR MAISCH", "title": "RECOGNIZING EINAR MAISCH"}
