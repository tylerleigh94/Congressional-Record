Madam Speaker, during National Gun Violence \nSurvivors Week, I rise to recognize my State of the Union guest, Mary \nMiller-Strobel, from my hometown of Berkley, Michigan.\n  After her brother, Ben, was honorably discharged from the military, \nMary grew concerned that Ben was at risk of self-harm. Mary and her \nfather drove to every gun store in their small town, begging them not \nto sell Ben a gun. But they had no legal recourse to block a store from \nselling Ben the gun that would end his life. Ben died by suicide soon \nthereafter.\n  Had Mary been able to seek an extreme risk protection order, Ben \nmight still be alive today.\n  Mary is now a Moms Demand Action leader and has turned her tragedy \ninto a triumphant story of fighting to prevent other families from \nsuffering this tremendous and preventable loss.\n  The House has passed commonsense gun violence legislation, and we \nwill pass red flag legislation, too. Now, we need the Senate to act, \nfor Mary and Ben, and for so many others.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker_bioguide": "L000592", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker": "None", "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 2}], "id": "CREC-2020-02-05-pt1-PgH839-4", "doc_title": "TAKE ACTION FOR GUN VIOLENCE SURVIVORS", "title": "TAKE ACTION FOR GUN VIOLENCE SURVIVORS"}
