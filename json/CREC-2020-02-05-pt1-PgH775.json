Madam Speaker, I am grateful to be \nrecognized by the Magnet Schools of America as a Champion of Magnet \nSchool Excellence and to be a steadfast supporter of magnet schools. I \nappreciate that President Donald Trump's praising of magnet schools was \nincluded last night in the State of the Union.\n  Last week, I had the opportunity to visit Dutch Fork Elementary \nSchool Academy of Environmental Sciences, a magnet school in Irmo, \nSouth Carolina. Dutch Fork is one of many amazing examples of how \nmagnet schools are important for academic excellence. I had the \nopportunity to meet with students and teachers and talk with them about \ntheir unique educational experiences.\n  I was thankful to talk with Katrina Goggins, the Director of \nCommunications for District Five of Lexington and Richland Counties, \nPrincipal Julius Scott, Assistant Principal Brandon Gantt, School \nDistrict Five Magnet Director Sara Wheeler, and Shirley Cope.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget \nSeptember the 11th in the global war on terrorism with the courageous \nleadership of President Donald Trump.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker_bioguide": "W000795", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker": "None", "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 2}], "id": "CREC-2020-02-05-pt1-PgH775", "doc_title": "SUPPORTING MAGNET SCHOOLS", "title": "SUPPORTING MAGNET SCHOOLS"}
