Madam Speaker, I rise in recognition of National Gun \nViolence Survivors Week, a time when we remember the tragic and life-\naltering impact of the gun violence epidemic that continues to affect \nthousands of families across the country.\n  Every year, 36,000 Americans are killed by gun violence and 100,000 \nAmericans are injured. In my city alone, an average of 765 people die \nof gun violence every year.\n  Too many families have been touched by this violence. Too many young \npeople go to school afraid. Too many Americans live in fear.\n  Last night, the President's State of the Union only mentioned \nfirearms once. And instead of presenting a plan, it defended the NRA.\n  We owe it to every survivor and to everyone who has been touched by \ngun violence to do more than hold a moment of science or post a hashtag \non Twitter. We owe the American people real action.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker_bioguide": "Q000023", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker": "None", "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 2}], "id": "CREC-2020-02-05-pt1-PgH774-5", "doc_title": "NATIONAL GUN VIOLENCE SURVIVORS WEEK", "title": "NATIONAL GUN VIOLENCE SURVIVORS WEEK"}
