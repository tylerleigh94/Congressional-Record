Madam Speaker, today, I rise in recognition \nof National Gun Violence Survivors Week.\n  Last month, with the leadership of my House colleagues and Senator \nElizabeth Warren, I was proud to introduce the Gun Violence Prevention \nand Community Safety Act, the most comprehensive piece of gun reform \nlegislation this Chamber has ever seen.\n  We will mandate universal background checks, which will help keep \nguns out of the hands of those who should not have them. We will crack \ndown on gun trafficking. And we will hold the gun industry accountable \nfor putting profits over the safety of the American people.\n  I promise today to fight so that not one more American is burdened \nwith living as a gun violence survivor because of irresponsible, \noutdated, and morally bankrupt Federal gun policies.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker_bioguide": "J000288", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker": "None", "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 2}], "id": "CREC-2020-02-05-pt1-PgH838-5", "doc_title": "PASS COMPREHENSIVE GUN REFORM", "title": "PASS COMPREHENSIVE GUN REFORM"}
