Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the importance of \nprotecting the Second Amendment to the Constitution.\n  In my district, Commissioners in Davidson, Davie, Iredell, and Rowan \nCounties in North Carolina recently passed resolutions that simply \naffirm the Second Amendment rights of their residents and declare that \nthese counties will never participate in the infringement of those \nrights through unconstitutional gun control.\n  Anti-gun politicians in neighboring Virginia and other States are \ntrying to undermine and overturn the Second Amendment. That is why \nthese measures in my State are both necessary and timely.\n  I commend these counties, and I remain fully committed to defending \nthe rights of responsible, law-abiding gun owners.\n  Madam Speaker, it is a people problem, not a device problem.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker_bioguide": "B001305", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker": "None", "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 2}], "id": "CREC-2020-02-05-pt1-PgH774-8", "doc_title": "HIGHLIGHTING IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING THE SECOND AMENDMENT", "title": "HIGHLIGHTING IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING THE SECOND AMENDMENT"}
