Madam President, over the last months, our country has \nbeen consumed by a single word, one that we don't use often in our \nordinary parlance. That word, of course, is ``impeachment.'' It has \nfilled our news channels, our Twitter feeds, and dinner conversations. \nIt has led to a wide-ranging debate on everything from the \nconstitutional doctrines of the separation of powers to the due process \nof law--two concepts which are the most fundamental building blocks of \nwho we are as a nation. It has even prompted those who typically have \nno interest in politics to tune into C-SPAN or into their favorite \ncable news channels.\n  The impeachment of a President of the United States is simply the \ngravest undertaking we can pursue in this country. It is the nuclear \noption in our Constitution--the choice of last resort--when a President \nhas committed a crime so serious that Congress must act rather than \nleave the choice to the voters in the election.\n  The Framers of the Constitution granted this awesome power to the \nU.S. Congress and placed their confidence in the Senate to use only \nwhen absolutely necessary, when there is no other choice.\n  This is a rare, historic moment for the Members of this Chamber. This \nhas been faced by the Senate only on two previous occasions during our \nConstitution's 232-year history--only two times previously. We should \nbe extraordinarily vigilant in ensuring that the impeachment power does \nnot become a regular feature of our differences and, in the process, \ncheapen the vote of the American people. Soon, Members of the Senate \nwill determine whether, for the first time in our history, a President \nwill be removed from office, and then we will decide whether he will be \nbarred from the ballot in 2020.\n  The question all Senators have to answer is, Did the President \ncommit, in the words of the Constitution, a high crime and misdemeanor \nthat warrants his removal from office or should he be acquitted of the \ncharges made by the House?\n  I did my best to listen intently to both sides as they presented \ntheir cases during the trial, and I am confident in saying that \nPresident Trump should be acquitted and not removed from office.\n  First, the Constitution gives the Congress the power to impeach and \nremove a President from office only for treason, bribery, and other \nhigh crimes and misdemeanors, but the two Articles of Impeachment \npassed by the House of Representatives fail to meet that standard.\n  The first charge, as we know, is abuse of power. House Democrats \nalleged that the President withheld military aid from Ukraine in \nexchange for investigations of Joe and Hunter\n\n\nBiden. But they failed to bring forward compelling and unassailable \nevidence of any crime--again, the Constitution talks about treason, \nbribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors; clearly, a criminal \nstandard--and thus failed to meet their burden of proof. Certainly, the \nHouse managers did not meet the high burden required to remove the \nPresident from office, effectively nullifying the will of tens of \nmillions of Americans just months before the next election. What is \nmore, the House's vague charge in the first article is equivalent to \nacts considered and rejected by the Framers of our Constitution.\n  That brings us to the second article we are considering--obstruction \nof Congress. During the House inquiry, Democrats were upset because \nsome of the President's closest advisers--and their most sought-after \nwitnesses--did not testify. To be clear, some of the executive branch \nwitnesses were among the 13 witnesses whose testimony we did hear \nduring the Senate trial. But for those witnesses for whom it was clear \nthe administration would claim a privilege, almost certainly leading to \na long court battle, the House declined to issue the subpoenas and \ncertainly did not seek judicial enforcement. Rather than addressing the \nprivilege claims in court, as happened in the Nixon and Clinton \nimpeachments, the Democratic managers moved to impeach President Trump \nfor obstruction of Congress for protecting the Presidency itself from a \npartisan abuse of power by the House.\n  Removing the President from office for asserting long-recognized and \nconstitutionally grounded privileges that have been invoked by both \nRepublican and Democratic Presidents would set a very dangerous \nprecedent and would do violence to the Constitution's separation of \npowers design. In effect, it would make the Presidency itself \nsubservient to Congress.\n  The father of our Constitution, James Madison, warned against \nallowing the impeachment power to create a Presidential tenure at the \npleasure of the Senate.\n  Even more concerning, at every turn throughout this process, the \nHouse Democrats violated President Trump's right to due process of law. \nAll American law is built on a constitutional foundation securing basic \nrights and rules of fairness for a citizen accused of wrongdoing.\n  It is undisputed that the House excluded the President's legal team \nfrom both the closed-door testimony and almost the entirety of the \nHouse's 78-day inquiry. They channeled personal, policy, and political \ngrievances and attempted to use the most solemn responsibility of \nCongress to bring down a political rival in a partisan process.\n  It is no secret that Democrats' crusade to remove the President began \nmore than 3 years ago on the very day he was inaugurated. On January \n20, 2017, the Washington Post ran a story with the headline ``The \ncampaign to impeach President Trump has begun.''\n  At first, Speaker Pelosi wisely resisted. Less than a year ago, she \nsaid, ``Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there is \nsomething so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think \nwe should go down that path because it divides the country.'' And she \nwas right. But when she couldn't hold back the stampede of her caucus, \nshe did a 180-degree about-face. She encouraged House Democrats to rush \nthrough an impeachment inquiry before an arbitrary Christmas deadline.\n  In the end, the articles passed with support from only a single \nparty--not bipartisan. The bipartisanship the Speaker claimed was \nnecessary was actually opposed to the impeachment of the President; \nthat is, Democrats and Republicans voted in opposition to the Articles \nof Impeachment. Only Democrats voted for the Articles of Impeachment in \nthe House.\n  Once the articles finally made it to the Senate after a confusing, \n28-day delay, Speaker Pelosi tried to have Senator Schumer--the \nDemocratic leader here--use Speaker Pelosi's playbook, and he staged a \nnumber of political votes every Member of the Senate knew would fail, \njust so he could secure some perceived political advantage against \nRepublican Senators in the 2020 election.\n  What should be a solemn, constitutional undertaking became partisan \nguerilla warfare to take down President Trump and make Senator Schumer \nthe next majority leader of the U.S. Senate.\n  All of this was done on the eve of an election and just days shy of \nthe first primary in Iowa.\n  Well, to say the timing was a coincidence would be laughable. This \npartisan impeachment process could not only remove the President from \noffice, it would also potentially prevent his name from appearing on \nthe ballot in November. We are only 9 months away from an election--9 \nmonths away from the American people voting on the direction of our \ncountry--but our Democratic colleagues don't trust the American people, \nso they have taken matters into their own hands.\n  This politically motivated impeachment sets a dangerous precedent. \nThis is a very important point. This is not just about President Trump; \nthis is about the Office of the Presidency and what precedent a \nconviction and removal would set for our Constitution and for our \nfuture. If successful, this would give a green light to future \nCongresses to weaponize impeachment to defeat a political opponent for \nany action--even a failure to kowtow to Congress's wishes.\n  Impeachment is a profoundly serious matter that must be handled as \nsuch. It cannot become the Hail Mary pass of a party to remove a \nPresident, effectively nullifying an election and interfering in the \nnext.\n  I believe--I think we should all believe--that the results of the \nnext election should be decided by the American people, not by \nCongress.\n  The decision to remove a President from office requires undeniable \nevidence of a high crime. That is the language chosen by the Framers of \nour Constitution. But despite our colleagues' best attempts, the facts \nthey presented simply don't add up to that standard.\n  House managers failed to meet their heavy burden of proof that \nPresident Trump, beyond a reasonable doubt, committed a crime, let \nalone a high crime; therefore, I will not vote to convict the \nPresident.\n  I hope our Democratic colleagues will finally accept the result of \nthis trial--just as they have not accepted the result of the 2016 \nelection--and I hope they won't take the advice of Congresswoman \nWaters, Maxine Waters in the House, and open a second impeachment \ninquiry. It is time for our country to come together to heal the wounds \nthat divide us and to get the people's work done.\n  There is no doubt, as Speaker Pelosi observed in March of 2019, that \nimpeachment is a source of division in our country, and it is also a \nperiod of great sadness. If this partisan impeachment were to succeed, \nmy greatest fear is it would become a routine process for every \nPresident who serves with a House majority of the opposite party, and \nwe would find ourselves in a recurring impeachment nightmare every time \nwe elect a new President.\n  Our country is deeply divided and damaged by this partisan \nimpeachment process. It is time for us to bring it to a close and to \nlet the wounds from this unnecessary and misguided episode heal.", "turn": 0, "speaker_bioguide": "C001056", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "recorder", "speaker": "The RECORDER", "text": "  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in ", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "recorder", "speaker": "The RECORDER", "text": "the Record, as follows:\n\n    Statement for the Record--Impeachment Trial of Donald John Trump\n\n\n                      Senator John Cornyn of Texas\n\n       Mr. President, I would like to submit this statement for \n     the record regarding the impeachment trial of President \n     Donald Trump. This statement seeks to supplement the remarks \n     that I made on the Senate floor on Wednesday, February 5, \n     2020. It includes some of my observations as a former judge \n     on some of the complicated constitutional, legal, and factual \n     issues associated with this impeachment proceeding and its \n     implications for future presidential impeachments.\n     (1) What is the Constitutional standard?\n       In America, all government derives its power, in the words \n     of the Declaration of Independence, ``from the consent of the \n     governed.'' \\1\\ This is not just a statement of national \n     policy, but a statement about legitimacy.\n       Elections are the principal means of conferring legitimacy \n     by the consent of the governed. Impeachments, by the House \n     and tried in the Senate, while conferring authority on 535 \n     Members of Congress to nullify one election and disqualify a \n     convicted President from appearing on a future ballot, \n     exercise delegated power from the governed, much attenuated \n     from the direct consent provided by\n\n\n     an election. It seems obvious that an impeachment of a \n     President during an election year should give rise to \n     heightened concerns about legitimacy.\n       While there was extensive argument on what the Framers \n     intended the impeachment standard to be, suffice it to say, \n     they believed it should be serious enough to warrant removal, \n     and disqualification from future office, of a duly elected \n     President.\n       The role of impeachments in a constitutional republic like \n     the United States was borrowed, to some extent, from our \n     British forebears. But it was not a wholesale acceptance of \n     the British model, with its parliamentary system where entire \n     governments can be removed on a vote of no confidence, but \n     rather a distinctly Americanized system that purposefully \n     created a strong and co-equal chief executive, elected by the \n     people for a definite term, with a narrowed scope of \n     impeachable offenses for the President.\n       Under the U.S. Constitution, Presidents may be impeached \n     for ``treason, bribery, and other high crimes and \n     misdemeanors.'' Due to the rarity of presidential \n     impeachments (three in 232 years), the age of some precedents \n     (dating back to the Johnson impeachment of 1868), and the \n     diversity of impeachment cases (and in particular, the \n     significant difference between the impeachment of judges and \n     Presidents), there remains quite a bit of debate about \n     precisely what actions by a President are impeachable.\n       Some argue a crime is not required, although all previous \n     presidential impeachments charged a crime. Some argue that \n     not all crimes are impeachable, only serious crimes can be \n     ``high'' crimes. Some categories, including ``malversation,'' \n     ``neglect of duty,'' ``corruption,'' ``malpractice,'' and \n     ``maladministration'' were considered and rejected by the \n     Framers.\\2\\\n     (2) Abuse of power\n       The President's lawyers charge that ``abuse of power'' \n     alleged in the first Article of Impeachment is not a crime, \n     much less a ``high'' crime, nor a violation of established \n     law. This argument raises Due Process of Law concerns with \n     regard to notice of what is prohibited. As Justice Antonin \n     Scalia observed shortly before his death in the criminal \n     context, ``invoking so shapeless a provision to condemn \n     someone . . . does not comport with the Constitution's \n     guarantee of due process.'' \\3\\\n       Moreover, they argue that ``abuse of power'' is tantamount \n     to ``maladministration,'' which was rejected by the Framers. \n     There is little doubt that a vague and ambiguous charge in an \n     Article of Impeachment can be a generalized accusation into \n     which the House can lump all of their political, policy, and \n     personal differences with a President. This should be \n     avoided.\n       The House Managers say no crime is required for \n     impeachment, and that abuse of power, which incorporates a \n     host of nefarious acts, is all that is required. No violation \n     of criminal statutes is alleged, nor required they say, and \n     they disagree that abuse of power equates with \n     ``maladministration.'' They point to Alexander Hamilton's \n     statement in Federalist 65 that impeachable offenses are \n     ``those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public \n     men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some \n     public trust.''\n     (3) Obstruction of Congress.\n       The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence issued \n     dozens of subpoenas and heard testimony from 17 witnesses. As \n     to other witness subpoenas issued to members of the Trump \n     Administration, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone argued in \n     his October 8, 2019 letter to Speaker of the House Pelosi \n     that any subpoenas issued before passage of a formal \n     resolution of the House establishing an impeachment inquiry \n     were constitutionally invalid and a violation of due process. \n     The House Managers rely on the Constitution's grant of the \n     ``sole power of impeachment'' to the House and argue that no \n     authorizing resolution was required. Essentially, they argue \n     that under the Constitution the House can run an \n     impeachment inquiry any way the House wants and no one can \n     complain.\n       No committee of the House was officially delegated the \n     House's impeachment authority until October 31, 2019, when \n     the House passed House Resolution 660 directing ``the \n     Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the Committees \n     on Financial Services, Foreign Affairs, the Judiciary, \n     Oversight and Reform, and Ways and Means to continue their \n     ongoing investigations as part of the existing House of \n     Representatives inquiry into whether sufficient grounds exist \n     for the House of Representatives to exercise its \n     constitutional power to impeach Donald John Trump, President \n     of the United States.''\n       Neither the House's theory that it could act without a \n     delegation resolution, nor the White House Counsel's argument \n     that subpoenas were void without one was presented to a court \n     during this impeachment inquiry.\\4\\ In fact, the House \n     intentionally avoided litigation because, as House Manager \n     Adam Schiff stated, it would slow down their inquiry.\n       One example makes this point. Charles Kupperman was a \n     deputy to former National Security Advisor John Bolton. Other \n     than Bolton himself, Kupperman was one of the officials most \n     likely to have direct knowledge of an alleged quid pro quo on \n     aid to Ukraine. But after the House subpoenaed him last fall, \n     Kupperman went to court and asked for a resolution of the \n     competing claims between the President and the House. Rather \n     than wait for a judicial determination in this interbranch \n     dispute, the House withdrew its subpoena and affirmatively \n     disclaimed any desire to pursue Kupperman's testimony in the \n     future.\\5\\ The House also decided not to subpoena Bolton or \n     any other key witnesses in the administration.\n       Instead, the House elected to push through impeachment with \n     an abbreviated period of roughly three months and declared \n     any delay by President Trump, even to seek judicial review, \n     to be obstruction of Congress and a high crime and \n     misdemeanor. The Administration is currently in court \n     challenging demands for witnesses and documents. Just a \n     couple weeks ago, the Supreme Court accepted such cases for \n     review and stayed the lower court decisions ordering the \n     production of President Trump's financial records from third \n     parties.\\6\\ Still, the House impeached President Trump before \n     the Supreme Court or other federal courts could rule on the \n     merits of claims of presidential privileges and immunities in \n     this impeachment inquiry.\n       The essence of the House's second Article of Impeachment is \n     that it is Obstruction of Congress to decline to voluntarily \n     submit to the House's inquiry and forgo any claims of \n     presidential privileges or immunities. One interpretation of \n     these facts is that the House simply gave up pursuing the \n     testimony in the interest of speed. While undoubtedly \n     litigation would have delayed for a time the House's \n     impeachment inquiry if they were determined to secure the \n     testimony they initially sought, it is clear that the \n     President, and not the witnesses, would assert claims of \n     executive privilege or absolute testimony immunity to protect \n     the Office of the Presidency. These claims are \n     constitutionally based in the separation of powers, long-\n     recognized by the Department of Justice's Office of Legal \n     Counsel, and repeatedly asserted by both Republican and \n     Democratic Administrations in countless disputes with \n     Congress. And since the House did not pursue the testimony \n     originally subpoenaed, the issue of presidential privileges \n     or immunity was never decided.\\7\\\n       But that is not all. Representative Eric Swalwell recently \n     declared that not only should a sitting president be \n     impeached if he or she goes to the courts rather than submit \n     to Congress, but that contesting demands for evidence is \n     actually evidence of guilt on all of the charged offenses. \n     Congressman Swalwell claimed ``we can only conclude that you \n     are guilty'' if someone refuses to give testimony or \n     documents to Congress.\\8\\ So much for the presumption of \n     innocence and other constitutional rights encompassed by the \n     Constitution's guarantee of Due Process of Law.\n       It is an odd argument that a person accused of running a \n     red light has more legal rights than a President being \n     impeached.\n     (4) The House's impeachment inquiry\n       The House Managers argue that since Article 1, Section 2 of \n     the Constitution gives the House the ``sole power of \n     impeachment,'' the President cannot question the procedures \n     as a denial of Due Process of Law or authority by which that \n     House produced the Articles. What they don't explain is how \n     House rules can preempt the Constitution. They can't. As \n     Chief Justice John Marshall wrote in Marbury v. Madison, \n     ``the Constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the \n     legislature, [and] the Constitution, and not such ordinary \n     act, must govern the case to which they both apply.'' \\9\\\n       While the Constitution gives the House the ``sole power to \n     impeach'' it gives the Senate the ``sole power to try all \n     impeachments.'' Some have analogized the House's role to a \n     grand jury in criminal cases. Generally speaking, a grand \n     jury may issue an indictment, also known as a ``true bill,'' \n     only if it finds, based upon the evidence that has been \n     presented to it, that there is probable cause to believe that \n     a crime has been committed by a criminal suspect.\n       But impeachment is not, strictly speaking, a criminal case, \n     even though the Constitution speaks in terms of \n     ``conviction'' and the impeachment standard is ``treason, \n     bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.'' Contrast \n     that with Article 1, Section 3, Clause 7: ``the Party \n     convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to \n     Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to \n     Law.'' In other words, the constitutional prohibition of \n     double jeopardy does not apply.\n       Neither are Senators jurors in the usual sense of being \n     ``disinterested'' in the facts or outcome. Senators take the \n     following oath: ``Do you solemnly swear that in all things \n     appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Donald John \n     Trump, President of the United States, now pending, you will \n     do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws, \n     so help you God?''\n       Hamilton wrote in Federalist 65 the Senate was chosen as \n     the tribunal for courts of impeachment because:\n       ``Where else than in the Senate could have been found a \n     tribunal sufficiently dignified, or sufficiently independent? \n     What other body would be likely to feel confidence enough in \n     its own situation, to preserve, unawed and uninfluenced, the \n     necessary impartiality between an individual accused, and the \n     representatives of the people, his accusers?''\n       Because impeachment is neither civil nor criminal in the \n     usual sense, it must be something different. President \n     Trump's counsel referred to the Senate role as sitting in a\n\n\n     ``High Court of Impeachment,'' and ``Democracy's ultimate \n     court.'' Hamilton, in Federalist 65, called it ``a method of \n     national inquest.''\n       One of most significant disputes in the Senate impeachment \n     trial of President Trump was the duty of the House to develop \n     evidence during its impeachment inquiry and the duty of the \n     Senate when new evidence is sought by one or both parties \n     during the trial. In addressing this issue, it is helpful to \n     remind ourselves that the American system of justice is \n     adversarial in nature. That is, it is a system that \n     ``resolves disputes by presenting conflicting views of fact \n     and law to an impartial and relatively passive arbiter, who \n     decides which side wins what.'' \\10\\ This system ``consists \n     of a core of basic rights that recognize and protect the \n     dignity of the individual in a free society.'' \\11\\\n       The rights that comprise the adversary system include . . . \n     the rights to call and to confront witnesses, and the right \n     to require the government to prove guilt beyond a reasonable \n     doubt. . . . These rights, and others, are also included in \n     the broad and fundamental concept [of] due process of law--a \n     concept which itself has been substantially equated with the \n     adversary system.'' \\12\\\n       The adversarial nature of these proceedings means that the \n     House Managers were obligated to develop their case, \n     including the evidence, in the House inquiry, and not rely on \n     the Senate to do so. In typical court proceedings, the \n     failure of the prosecutor to present sufficient evidence at \n     trial results in dismissal, not in open-ended discovery or a \n     re-opened investigation.\n       President Trump's lawyers argued that there were three main \n     errors in the House proceedings:\n       (1) The House did not initially authorize the impeachment \n     inquiry, thus delegating its ``sole power'' to the \n     Intelligence Committee, which issued dozens of subpoenas the \n     President deemed invalid;\n       (2) Numerous due process violations during the Intelligence \n     Committee's proceedings, including denial of notice, counsel, \n     cross examination, and the opportunity to call witnesses;\n       (3) And, finally, that as an interested fact witness \n     regarding Intelligence Committee contacts with the \n     whistleblower, Chairman Schiff could not be said to have \n     fairly conducted the House investigation.\n       Again, the House Managers argue that the method by which \n     the Articles of Impeachment were approved in the House cannot \n     be challenged in the Senate trial given the House's ``sole \n     power to impeach.''\n       Ominously, the President's lawyers argue that whatever \n     precedent was set by the Senate in this trial would be the \n     ``new normal'' and govern not just this trial but all \n     impeachment trials in the future. They also argue that to \n     make impeachment ``too easy'' in the House will result in \n     more frequent presidential impeachments being approved by \n     this and future Houses, which the Senate would then be \n     obligated to try. Similarly, they argue that the Senate \n     should not reward the failure of the House to litigate \n     questions of presidential privileges and immunities in their \n     impeachment inquiry and transfer that burden to the Senate. \n     An important difference between the House and Senate is that \n     House inquiries can be delegated to committees while the \n     House conducts other business; not so in the Senate, which \n     must sit as a court of impeachment until the trial is \n     completed.\n       Thus, during a Senate impeachment trial, absent unanimous \n     consent--unlikely given the contentious nature of the \n     proceedings--the Senate is precluded from any other business, \n     even during delays while executive privilege and similar \n     issues are litigated in the courts. Given that the House \n     chose to not seek judicial enforcement of subpoenas during \n     its impeachment inquiry because of concerns about delay, the \n     question is do they have a right to do so during the Senate \n     trial? If so, the President's lawyers claim, such an outcome \n     would significantly protract a Senate trial and permanently \n     alter the relationship between the House and Senate in \n     impeachment proceedings. Indeed, there is a strong textual \n     and structural argument that the Constitution prohibits the \n     Senate from performing the investigative role assigned to the \n     House.\n       The House Managers contend that Chief Justice John Roberts \n     could rule on questions of privilege while presiding over the \n     impeachment trial, avoiding delay during litigation, but the \n     Chief Justice made clear his was not a judicial role in the \n     usual sense.\\13\\ When the issue of whether the Chief Justice \n     would be a tie-breaking vote came up during the trial, he \n     said: ``I think it would be inappropriate for me, an \n     unelected official from a different branch of government, to \n     assert the power to change that result so that the motion \n     would succeed.'' So it is that the Senate, not the Chief \n     Justice presiding in an essentially ceremonial role during \n     impeachment trials, determines disputed issues. This \n     conclusion is further supported by the rule that a majority \n     of Senators are empowered to effectively ``overrule'' an \n     initial determination by the presiding officer. In the words \n     of Senate Impeachment Rule Seven: ``The presiding officer \n     may, in the first instance, submit to the Senate, without a \n     division, all questions of evidence and incidental questions; \n     but the same shall, on the demand of one-fifth of the members \n     present, be decided by yeas and nays.'' The unseemliness of \n     imposing this role on the Chief Justice is obvious and should \n     be avoided.\n     (5) The Facts\n       Of course, the main factual contentions of the House \n     Managers involve President Trump's interest in an \n     investigation of Hunter and Joe Biden's role in Ukraine. They \n     allege the President's ``corrupt'' motive to dig up dirt on a \n     potential political rival is an abuse of power. The \n     President's lawyers argue that it is clearly within the \n     President's authority to investigate corruption and leverage \n     foreign aid in order to combat it. Even if it incidentally \n     helps the President electorally, they argue it is not a \n     ``high crime and misdemeanor.''\n       But there are more basic factual conundrums. Any \n     investigations discussed in the July 25 conversation between \n     Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and President Trump \n     never occurred. And the foreign aid, including lethal \n     defensive aid and weapons, was paused for just a short time \n     and delivered on September 11, 2019, before the deadline of \n     September 30.\n       The abuse of power alleged was based on desired \n     investigations and the withholding of foreign aid. But \n     neither, ultimately, occurred. This is similar to an \n     ``attempted'' offense under the criminal law. Indeed, the law \n     criminalizes a host of attempted offenses. But the Articles \n     of Impeachment do not charge President Trump with any crimes, \n     including any ``attempted'' offenses.\n     (6) Burden of Proof\n       President Trump's counsel argued that the appropriate \n     burden of proof in this quasi-criminal trial is ``proof \n     beyond a reasonable doubt.'' This point was not seriously \n     contested by the House Managers who repeatedly claimed the \n     evidence in support of the Articles of Impeachment was \n     ``overwhelming.'' Manager Jerry Nadler went further and \n     claimed, repeatedly, that the evidence produced was \n     ``conclusive'' and ``uncontested.'' Manager Zoe Lofgren \n     argued that Senators could use, literally, any standard they \n     wished.\n       This is significant on the issue of the President's motive \n     in seeking a corruption investigation from President \n     Zelensky, one that included former Vice President Biden and \n     his son, Hunter, and the company on whose board he served, \n     Burisma. The House Managers argued, repeatedly, that \n     President Trump did not care about Ukrainian corruption or \n     burden sharing with allies and that his sole motive was to \n     get information damaging to a political rival, Joe Biden.\n       President Trump's lawyers contend that he has a record of \n     concerns about burden sharing with allies, as well as \n     corruption, and produced several examples. At most, they say, \n     his was a mixed motive--partly policy, partly political--and \n     in any event it was not a crime and thus not impeachable.\n       Therefore, the question arises: did the House Managers \n     prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the sole motive for \n     pausing military aid to Ukraine was for his personal benefit? \n     Or, did they fail to meet their burden?\n     Conclusion\n       Ultimately, the House Managers failed to prove beyond a \n     reasonable doubt that President Trump's sole motive for \n     seeking any corruption investigation in Ukraine, including of \n     Hunter Biden, was for a personal political benefit. This is \n     particularly true given the evidence of President Trump's \n     documented interest in financial burden sharing with allies, \n     and the widely shared concerns, including by the Obama/Biden \n     Administration, with corruption in Ukraine and the need to \n     protect American taxpayers.\n       Even if President Trump had mixed motives--a public \n     interest combined with a personal interest--the fact is the \n     investigations never occurred and the aid to Ukraine was \n     paused but delivered on schedule.\n       Moreover, none of the above conduct rises to the level of a \n     ``high crime and misdemeanor.'' The first article, Abuse of \n     Power, which charges no crime or violation of existing law is \n     too vague and ambiguous to meet the Constitution's \n     requirements. It is simply a conclusion into which any \n     disagreeable conduct can be lumped.\n       Finally, the second article, Obstruction of Congress, \n     cannot be sustained on this record. The President's counsel \n     argued persuasively that its subpoenas were largely \n     unauthorized in the absence of a House resolution delegating \n     its authority to a House committee. What's more, the House \n     never sought to enforce its subpoenas in the courts, \n     essentially giving up efforts to do so in favor of expediting \n     the House impeachment inquiry. The desire to meet an \n     arbitrary deadline before Christmas was prioritized over a \n     judicial determination in the interbranch dispute.\n\n\n                                endnotes\n\n       1.

Madam President, I come here today with the business of \nimpeachment before this Chamber. It should hardly be necessary at this \nlate juncture to outline again the train of abuses and distortions and \noutright lies that have brought us to today's impeachment vote: the \nsecret meetings in the Capitol basement; the closed hearings without \ndue process or basic fairness; the failure of the House to follow their \nown rules and authorize an impeachment inquiry and then the bipartisan \nvote against impeachment; and the attempt to manipulate or even prevent \na trial here in the Senate--holding the Articles of Impeachment for 33 \ndays--in brazen defiance of the Constitution's mandates.\n  The House Democrats have given us the first purely partisan \nimpeachment in our history and the first attempt to remove an elected \nPresident that does not even allege unlawful conduct.\n  Animating it all has been the bitter resentment of a professional \npolitical class that cannot accept the verdict of the people in 2016, \nthat cannot accept the people's priorities, and that now seeks to \noverturn the election and entrench themselves in power. That is how we \narrived at this moment, that is how we got here, and that is what this \nis really about.\n  Now it is time to bring this fiasco to a close. It is time to end \nthis cycle of retribution and payback and bitterness. It is time to end \nthe abuse of our institutions. It is time to let the verdict of the \npeople stand. So I will vote today to acquit the President of these \ncharges.\n  You know, it has been clear for a long time that impeachment is not a \npriority of the people--it is not even close. It is a pipe dream of \npoliticians. And as the Democrats have forced it on this country over \nthese many months, it has sapped our energy and diverted our attention \nfrom the real issues that press upon our country, the issues the people \nof this Nation have tried to get this town to care about for years. I \nmean the crisis of surging suicides and drug addiction that is driving \ndown life expectancy in my State and across this Nation. I mean the \ncrisis at the border, where those drugs are pouring across. I mean the \ncrisis of skyrocketing healthcare costs, which burden families, young \nand old, with bills they cannot pay. I mean the crisis of affordable \nhousing, which robs parents of a safe place to raise their children and \nbuild a life. I mean the crisis of trafficking and exploitation, which \nrobs our young girls and boys of a future and our society of their \ninnocence. I mean the crisis of the family farm and the crisis of \neducation costs for those who go to college and the lack of good-paying \njobs for those who don't. I mean the crisis of connectivity in our \nheartland, where too many schoolchildren can't access the internet even \nto do their homework at night. I mean the crisis of unfair trade and \nlost jobs and broken homes. And I could go on.\n  My point is this: When I listen to the people of my State, I don't \nhear about impeachment. No, I hear about the problems of home and \nneighborhood, of family and community, about the loss of faith in our \ngovernment and about the struggle to find hope for the future. This \ntown owes it to these Americans--the ones who sent us here--finally to \nlisten, finally to act, and finally to do something that really matters \nto them.\n  We must leave this impeachment circus behind us and ensure that our \nConstitution is never again abused in this way. It is time to turn the \npage. It is time to turn to a new politics of the people and to a \npolitics of home. It is time to turn to the future--a future where this \ntown finally accepts the people's judgment and the people's verdict and \nwhere this town finally delivers for the people who elected them; a \nfuture where the middle of our society gets a fair shake and a level \nplaying field; a future where maybe--maybe--this town will finally \nlisten.\n  When I think of all the energy and all the effort that has been \nexpended on this impeachment crusade over almost 3 years now, I wonder \nwhat might have been.\n  Today is a sad day, but it does not have to remain that way. Imagine \nwhat we might achieve for the good of this Nation if we turn our energy \nand our effort to the work of the American people. Imagine what we \ncould do to keep families in their homes and to bring new possibility \nto the Nation's heartland and to care for our children in every part of \nthis society. Imagine what we could do to lift up the most vulnerable \namong us who have been exploited and trafficked and give them new hope \nand new life. Imagine what we could do for those who have been \nforgotten, from our rural towns to our inner cities. Imagine what we \ncould do to give them control over their own destinies.\n  We can find the common good. We can push the boundaries of the \npossible. We can rebuild this Nation if we will listen to the American \npeople.

Madam President, in this impeachment proceeding, I \nworked with other Senators to make sure that we had the right to ask \nfor more documents and witnesses, but there was no need for more \nevidence to prove something that I believe had already been proven and \nthat did not meet the U.S. Constitution's high bar for an impeachable \noffense.\n  There was no need for more evidence to prove that the President asked \nUkraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. He said this on \ntelevision on October 3, 2019, and he said it during his July 25, 2019, \ntelephone call with the President of Ukraine.\n  There was no need for more evidence to conclude that the President \nwithheld United States aid, at least in part, to pressure Ukraine to \ninvestigate the Bidens. The House managers have proved this with what \nthey called a ``mountain of overwhelming evidence.'' One of the \nmanagers said it was ``proved beyond a shadow of a doubt.''\n  There was no need to consider further the frivolous second Article of \nImpeachment that would remove from the President and future \nPresidents--remove this President for asserting his constitutional \nprerogative to protect confidential conversations with his close \nadvisers.\n\n\n  It was inappropriate for the President to ask a foreign leader to \ninvestigate his political opponent and to withhold U.S. aid to \nencourage this investigation. When elected officials inappropriately \ninterfere with such investigations, it undermines the principle of \nequal justice under the law. But the Constitution does not give the \nSenate the power to remove the President from office and ban him from \nthis year's ballot simply for actions that are inappropriate.\n  The question, then, is not whether the President did it but whether \nthe Senate or the American people should decide what to do about what \nhe did. I believe that the Constitution clearly provides that the \npeople should make that decision in the Presidential election that \nbegan on Monday in Iowa.\n  The Senate has spent 11 long days considering this mountain of \nevidence, the arguments of the House managers and the President's \nlawyers, their answers to Senators' questions, and the House record. \nEven if the House charges were true, they don't meet the Constitution's \n``Treason, Bribery, or other High Crimes and Misdemeanors'' standard \nfor impeachable offense.\n  The Framers believed that there never ever should be a partisan \nimpeachment. That is why the Constitution requires a two-thirds vote of \nthe Senate to convict. Yet not one House Republican voted for these \narticles.\n  If this shallow, hurried, and wholly partisan impeachment were to \nsucceed, it would rip the country apart, pouring gasoline on the fire \nof cultural divisions that already exist. It would create a weapon of \nperpetual impeachment to be used against future Presidents whenever the \nHouse of Representatives is of a different political party.\n  Our founding documents provide for duly elected Presidents who serve \nwith ``the consent of the governed,'' not at the pleasure of the U.S. \nCongress. Let the people decide.\n  A year ago, at the Southeastern Conference basketball tournament, a \nfriend of 40 years sitting in front of me turned to me and said: ``I am \nvery unhappy with you for voting against the President.'' She was \nreferring to my vote against the President's decision to spend money \nthat Congress hadn't appropriated to build the border wall.\n  I believed then and now that the U.S. Constitution gives to the \nCongress the exclusive power to appropriate money. This separation of \npowers creates checks and balances in our government that preserve our \nindividual liberty by not allowing, in that case, the Executive to have \ntoo much power.\n  I replied to my friend: ``Look, I was not voting for or against the \nPresident. I was voting for the United States Constitution.'' Well, she \nwasn't convinced.\n  This past Sunday, walking my dog Rufus in Nashville, I was confronted \nby a neighbor who said she was angry and crushed by my vote against \nallowing more witnesses in the impeachment trial. ``The Senate should \nremove the President for extortion,'' she said.\n  I replied to her: ``I was not voting for or against the President. I \nwas voting for the United States Constitution, which, in my view, does \nnot give the Senate the power to remove a President from his office and \nfrom this year's election ballot simply for actions that are \ninappropriate. The United States Constitution says a President may be \nconvicted only for Treason, Bribery, and other High Crimes and \nMisdemeanors. President Trump's actions regarding Ukraine are a far cry \nfrom that. Plus,'' I said, ``unlike the Nixon impeachment, when almost \nall Republicans voted to initiate an impeachment inquiry, not one \nsingle Republican voted to initiate this impeachment inquiry against \nPresident Trump. The Trump impeachment,'' I said to her, ``was a \ncompletely partisan action, and the Framers of the United States \nConstitution, especially James Madison, believed we should never ever \nhave a partisan impeachment. That would undermine the separation of \npowers by allowing the House of Representatives to immobilize the \nexecutive branch, as well as the Senate, by a perpetual partisan series \nof impeachments.'' Well, she was not convinced.\n  When our country was created, there never had been anything quite \nlike it--a democratic republic with a written Constitution. Perhaps its \ngreatest innovation was the separation of powers among the Presidency, \nthe Supreme Court, and the Congress.\n  The late Justice Scalia said this of checks and balances: ``Every tin \nhorn dictator in the world today, every president for life, has a Bill \nof Rights. . . . What has made us free is our Constitution.'' What he \nmeant was, what makes the United States different and protects our \nindividual liberty is the separation of powers and the checks and \nbalances in our Constitution.\n  The goal of our Founders was not to have a King as a chief executive, \non the one hand, or not to have a British-style parliament, on the \nother, which could remove our chief executive or prime minister with a \nmajority or no-confidence vote. The principle reason our Constitution \ncreated a U.S. Senate is so that one body of Congress can pause and \nresist the excesses of the Executive or popular passions that could run \nthrough the House of Representatives like a freight train.\n  The language of the Constitution, of course, is subject to \ninterpretation, but on some things, its words are clear. The President \ncannot spend money that Congress doesn't appropriate--that is clear--\nand the Senate can't remove a President for anything less than treason, \nbribery, high crimes and misdemeanors, and two-thirds of us, the \nSenators, must agree on that. That requires a bipartisan consensus.\n  We Senators take an oath to base our decisions on the provisions of \nour Constitution, which is what I have endeavored to do during this \nimpeachment proceeding.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to include a few documents \nin the Record following my remarks. They include an editorial from \nFebruary 3 from the Wall Street Journal; an editorial from the National \nReview, also dated February 3; an opinion editorial by Robert Doar, \npresident of the American Enterprise Institute on February 1; an \narticle from KnoxTNToday, yesterday; and a transcript from my \nappearance on ``Meet the Press'' on Sunday, February 2, 2020.

On the contrary, we think it was Lamar \n     Alexander's finest hour.\n       The Tennessee Republican, who isn't running for re-election \n     this year, was a decisive vote in the narrowly divided Senate \n     on calling witnesses. He listened to the evidence and \n     arguments from both sides, and then he offered his sensible \n     judgment: Even if Mr. Trump did what House managers charge, \n     it still isn't enough to remove a President from office.``It \n     was inappropriate for the president to ask a foreign leader \n     to investigate his political opponent and to withhold United \n     States aid to encourage that investigation,'' Mr. Alexander \n     said in a statement Thursday night. ``But the Constitution \n     does not give the Senate the power to remove the president \n     from office and ban him from this year's ballot simply for \n     actions that are inappropriate.''\n       The House managers had proved their case to his \n     satisfaction even without new witnesses, Mr. Alexander added, \n     but ``they do not meet the Constitution's `treason, bribery, \n     or other high crimes and misdemeanors' standard for an \n     impeachable offense.'' Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse told reporters \n     ``let me be clear: Lamar speaks for lots and lots of us.''\n       This isn't an abdication. It's a wise judgment based on \n     what Mr. Trump did and the rushed, partisan nature of the \n     House impeachment. Mr. Trump was wrong to ask Ukraine to \n     investigate Joe and Hunter Biden, and wrong to use U.S. aid \n     as leverage. His call with Ukraine's President was far from \n     ``perfect.'' It was reckless and self-destructive, as Mr. \n     Trump often is.\n       Nearly all of his advisers and several Senators opposed his \n     actions, Senators like Wisconsin's Ron Johnson lobbied Mr. \n     Trump hard against the aid delay, and in the end the aid was \n     delivered within the fiscal year and Ukraine did not begin an \n     investigation. Even the House managers did not allege \n     specific crimes in their impeachment articles. For those who \n     want the best overall account of what happened, we again \n     recommend the Nov. 18 letter that Mr. Johnson wrote to House \n     Republicans.\n       Mr. Alexander's statement made two other crucial points. \n     The first concerns the damage that partisan removal of Mr. \n     Trump would do to the country.\n\n\n       ``The framers believed that there should never, ever be a \n     partisan impeachment. That is why the Constitution requires a \n     2/3 vote of the Senate for conviction. Yet not one House \n     Republican voted for these articles,'' Mr. Alexander noted. \n     ``If this shallow, hurried and wholly partisan impeachment \n     were to succeed, it would rip the country apart, pouring \n     gasoline on the fire of cultural divisions that already \n     exist. It would create the weapon of perpetual impeachment to \n     be used against future presidents whenever the House of \n     Representatives is of a different political party.''\n       Does anyone who isn't a Resistance partisan doubt this? \n     Democrats and the press talk as if removing Mr. Trump is a \n     matter of constitutional routine that would restore American \n     politics to some pre-2016 normalcy. That's a dangerous \n     illusion.\n       The ouster of Mr. Trump, the political outsider, on such \n     slender grounds would be seen by half the country as an \n     insider coup d'etat. Unlike Richard Nixon's resignation, it \n     would never be accepted by Mr. Trump's voters, who would wave \n     it as a bloody flag for years to come. Payback against the \n     next Democratic President when the Republicans retake the \n     House would be a certainty.\n       Mr. Alexander directed Americans to the better solution of \n     our constitutional bedrock. ``The question then is not \n     whether the president did it, but whether the United States \n     Senate or the American people should decide what to do about \n     what he did,'' his statement said. ``Our founding documents \n     provide for duly elected presidents who serve with `the \n     consent of the governed,' not at the pleasure of the United \n     States Congress. Let the people decide.''\n       Democrats and their allies in the media have spent three \n     years trying to nullify the election their candidate lost in \n     2016. They have hawked false Russian conspiracy theories, \n     ignored abuse by the FBI, floated fantasies about triggering \n     the 25th Amendment, and tried to turn bad presidential \n     judgment toward Ukraine into an impeachable offense. Yet Mr. \n     Trump's job approval rating has increased during the \n     impeachment hearings and trial.\n       Our friendly advice to Democrats and the impeachment press \n     is to accept that you lost fair and square in 2016 and focus \n     on nominating a better Democratic candidate this year. On the \n     recent polling evidence, that task is urgent.

But this misconduct, he argued, doesn't rise \n     to the level of the high crimes and misdemeanors required to \n     remove a president from office. If the Senate were to do so \n     anyway, it would further envenom the nation's partisan \n     divide. Besides, there is a national election looming where \n     the public itself can decide whether Trump should stay in \n     office or not.\n       Since we already know the core of what happened, Alexander \n     explained, there was no need to hear from additional \n     witnesses in the Senate trial. (On this theory of the case, \n     the Senate is in effect acting like an appellate court, \n     rendering a judgment on a threshold question of law, rather \n     than a trial court sifting through the facts.)\n       In the wake of Alexander's statement, other Senate \n     Republicans endorsed his line of analysis, which, it must be \n     noted, is superior to the defense mounted by the White House \n     legal team over the last two weeks.\n       Because the president refused to acknowledge what he did, \n     his team implausibly denied there was a quid pro quo and \n     argued that one hadn't been proven since there were no first-\n     hand witnesses. Obviously, this position was at odds with the \n     defense team's insistence that no further witnesses be \n     called. It also raised the natural question why, if people \n     with firsthand knowledge had exculpatory information, the \n     White House wasn't eager to let them come forward.\n       Additionally, the White House maintained that a president \n     can't be impeached unless he's guilty of a criminal \n     violation. This is an erroneous interpretation of the \n     Constitution, although it is true that past presidential \n     impeachments have involved violations of the law and that \n     such violations provide a bright line that's missing if the \n     charge is only abuse of power. Alan Dershowitz argued this \n     position most aggressively for the president's defense, and \n     made it even worse by briefly seeming--before walking it \n     back--to argue that anything a president does to advance his \n     reelection is properly motivated.\n       As for the House managers, they were at their strongest \n     making the case that the president had done what they \n     alleged, and their weakest arguing that he should be removed \n     for it.\n       They tried to inflate the gravity of Trump's offense by \n     repeatedly calling it ``election interference.'' At the end \n     of the day, though, what the Trump team sought was not an \n     investigation of Joe or Hunter Biden, but a statement by the \n     Ukrainians that they'd look into Burisma, the Ukrainian \n     company on whose board Hunter Biden sat. The firm has a shady \n     past and has been investigated before. Trump should have \n     steered clear of anything involving his potential opponent, \n     but it's not obvious that a new Burisma probe would have had \n     any effect on 2020 (the vulnerability for Biden is Hunter's \n     payments, which are already on the record) and, of course, \n     the announcement of an investigation never happened.\n       They said that Trump's seeking this Ukrainian interference \n     was in keeping with his welcoming of Russian meddling, \n     implying that Trump had been found guilty of colluding with \n     the Russians in 2016, rather than exonerated. (Part of the \n     complaint here is that Trump made use of material that \n     emerged via Russian hacking. Then again, so did Bernie \n     Sanders in his fight with the DNC.)\n       They alleged that the brief delay in aid to Ukraine somehow \n     endangered our national security, a risible claim given that \n     the Ukrainians got the aid and that Trump has provided \n     Ukraine lethal assistance that President Obama never did.\n       They accused the president of obstruction of justice for \n     asserting privileges invoked by other presidents and not \n     producing documents and witnesses on the House's accelerated \n     timeline, a charge that White House lawyer Patrick Philbin \n     effectively dismantled.\n       Finally, they insisted that a trial without witnesses \n     wouldn't be fair, despite making no real effort to secure the \n     new witnesses during their own rushed impeachment inquiry.\n       As for the Senate trial being a ``cover up,'' as Democrats \n     now insist it is, there is nothing stopping the House--or the \n     Senate, for that matter--from seeking testimony from John \n     Bolton and others outside the confines of the trial. This \n     would be entirely reasonable congressional oversight (despite \n     the White House arguing otherwise) and there is still a \n     public interest in knowing as much as possible about this \n     matter, even if Trump isn't going to be removed.\n       If nothing else, the last two weeks have been a forum for \n     extensive discussion about the respective powers of the two \n     elected branches of government. We are sympathetic to the \n     view that the executive branch has too much power. If \n     Congress seeks to remedy this imbalance by impeaching and \n     removing presidents, though, it will be sorely disappointed, \n     since the two-thirds requirement for a Senate conviction is \n     an almost insuperable obstacle to removal (as both House \n     Republicans and House Democrats have experienced the last 20 \n     years).\n       It would be better if Congress undertook a more systematic \n     effort to take back prerogatives it has ceded to the \n     executive branch and the courts. But we aren't optimistic on \n     this score, since the same Democrats who claim to be \n     sticklers about congressional power on the Ukraine matter \n     won't say a discouraging word about Elizabeth Warren's and \n     Bernie Sanders's promised adventures in unilateral rule as \n     president.\n       At the end of the day, Nancy Pelosi impeached knowing that \n     the Senate wouldn't convict, and so here we are--with nine \n     months to go until voters get to make their judgment: not \n     just about Ukraine, but about the last four years and Trump's \n     eventual opponent.", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker": "None", "text": "                                  ____\n\n\n                      [From the AEI, Feb. 1, 2020]\n\n      Alexander Got It Right: It Takes More To Remove a President\n\n                            (By Robert Doar)\n\n       ``It was inappropriate for the president to ask a foreign \n     leader to investigate his political opponent and to withhold \n     United States aid to encourage that investigation. When \n     elected officials inappropriately interfere with such \n     investigations, it undermines the principle of equal justice \n     under the law. But the Constitution does not give the Senate \n     the power to remove the president from office and ban him \n     from this year's ballot simply for actions that are \n     inappropriate.''\n       Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander's words reminded me of the \n     struggle my father, John Doar, had as he considered whether \n     the conduct of President Richard Nixon was so serious that it \n     should lead the House to impeach him and the Senate to remove \n     him from office. Dad was in charge of the House Judiciary \n     Committee staff, which took seven months (between December \n     1973 and July 1974) to examine the evidence and consider the \n     question. What he concluded, and what the House Judiciary \n     Committee by bipartisan majorities also found, was that Nixon \n     deserved impeachment and removal for a pattern of conduct \n     over a multi-year period that both obstructed justice and \n     abused power.\n       So the first article, concerning obstruction of justice, \n     found that Nixon and his subordinates had tampered with \n     witnesses and interfered with the Department of Justice's \n     investigations. They had paid hush money and attempted to \n     misuse the CIA. And they had lied repeatedly to investigators \n     and the American people.\n       On abuse of power, Nixon was found to have misused his \n     authority over the IRS, the FBI, the CIA, and the Secret \n     Service to defeat political opponents and protect himself, \n     and in the process he had violated the constitutional rights \n     of citizens. After he came\n\n\n     under suspicion, he tried to manipulate these agencies to \n     interfere with the investigation.\n       President Trump's conduct toward Ukraine, though \n     inappropriate, differs significantly from Nixon's in one \n     crucial respect. Where Nixon's impeachable abuse of power \n     occurred over a period of several years, the conduct \n     challenged by the House's impeachment of Trump was not nearly \n     as prolonged. From July to September of last year, Trump \n     attempted to cajole a foreign government to open an \n     investigation into his political opponent. That conduct was \n     wrong. But it's not the same as what Nixon did over multiple \n     years.\n       This contrast brings to light a critical difference between \n     the House's behavior in 1974 and its efforts today. When \n     Nixon's actions came to light, the House conducted an \n     impeachment the right way: The House Judiciary Committee took \n     seven months to examine all of the evidence, built up a \n     theory of the case which matched the Constitution's \n     requirements, and produced charges that implicated the \n     president and his subordinates in a pattern of impeachable \n     conduct. Faced with certain impeachment and removal from \n     office, Nixon resigned. What Trump attempted to do, as \n     Alexander rightly sees, is not that.\n       Alexander is right about one other thing--we should let the \n     people decide who our next president should be.", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker": "None", "text": "                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Knox TN Today, Feb. 4, 2020]\n\n                            Lamar Was Right\n\n                            (By Frank Cagle)\n\n       Since I'm older than dirt, there have been occasions over \n     the years when first-term state legislators would ask me if I \n     had any advice for them.\n       Yes.\n       When a major and controversial issue looms study it, decide \n     where you are and let everyone know where you are.

Yours will be \n     the only vote anyone remembers.\n       You would think someone who has been around as long as \n     Lamar Alexander could avoid this trap. But not so. In the \n     impeachment trial of President Trump, he got the label \n     undecided, he was then hounded by the media and hammered by \n     both sides over whether he would march in lockstep with \n     Majority Leader Mitch McConnell or whether he would vote to \n     call more witnesses as the Democrats wanted.\n       And horror of horrors, he was the deciding vote and the \n     only one that will be remembered. When he announced how he \n     would vote the ``more witnesses'' movement collapsed.\n       Alexander now finds himself being excoriated by both sides. \n     The Trump supporters will never forget his failure to fall in \n     line and salute. The anti-Trumpers are expressing their \n     disappointment.\n       I've never been a Lamar fan. But I would like to make the \n     case that he did exactly the right thing and he expressed the \n     position of the majority of his Republican colleagues. He, \n     and anyone who has been paying attention, says Trump did what \n     he was accused of and what he did was wrong--inappropriate. \n     But it did not rise to the level of removing him from office. \n     There was no point in listening to additional witnesses and \n     dragging things out. Everyone knew he was guilty. But if \n     Trump is to be removed from office, let the voters do it.\n       If you believe that Trump didn't hold up aid to Ukraine or \n     that he didn't ask them to investigate Joe Biden you have \n     surrendered your critical faculties or you haven't been \n     paying attention.\n       Joe and Hunter Biden should be investigated. By the FBI. I \n     understand Trump's frustration that the mainstream media \n     could not be counted on to investigate what should be \n     disqualifying information about Biden's presidential run. (In \n     the media's defense, Trump's kids are also trading off their \n     father's position.) Trump's problem is that instead of \n     turning to the FBI he turned the problem over to Rudy \n     Giuliani and a couple of his questionable associates, \n     otherwise known as the ``Gang Who Couldn't Shoot Straight.''\n       I doubt you could find 10 Republican senators who, in their \n     heart of hearts, didn't agree with Lamar's position.

Senator Alexander, welcome back.\n       Senator Lamar Alexander: Thank you, Chuck.\n       Todd: So one of the reasons you gave in your release about \n     not voting for more witnesses is that--and to decide that, \n     okay, this trial is over, let's let the people decide--was \n     that the election was too close. So let me ask you though, on \n     the witness vote itself, would it be helpful for the people \n     to decide if they had more information?\n       Alexander: Well, I mean, if you have eight witnesses who \n     say someone left the scene of an accident, why do you need \n     nine? I mean, the question for me was, do I need more \n     evidence to conclude that the president did what he did? And \n     I concluded no. So I voted.\n       Todd: What do you believe he did?\n       Alexander: What I believe he did. One, was that he called \n     the president of Ukraine and asked him to become involved in \n     investigating Joe Biden, who was--\n       Todd: You believe his wrongdoing began there, not before?\n       Alexander: I don't know about that, but he admitted that. \n     The president admitted that. He released the transcript. He \n     said it on television. The second thing was, at least in \n     part, he delayed the military and other assistance to Ukraine \n     in order to encourage that investigation. Those are the two \n     things he did. I think he shouldn't have done it. I think it \n     was wrong. Inappropriate was the way I'd say it, improper, \n     crossing the line. And then the only question left is, who \n     decides what to do about that?\n       Todd: Well, who decides what to do with that?\n       Alexander: The people. The people is my conclusion. You \n     know, it struck me really for the first time early last week, \n     that we're not just being asked to remove the president from \n     office. We're saying, tell him you can't run in the 2020 \n     election, which begins Monday in Iowa.\n       Todd: If this weren't an election year, would you have \n     looked at this differently?\n       Alexander: I would have looked at it differently and \n     probably come to the same conclusion because I think what he \n     did is a long way from treason, bribery, high crimes and \n     misdemeanors. I don't think it's the kind of inappropriate \n     action that the framers would expect the Senate to substitute \n     its judgment for the people in picking a president.\n       Todd: Does it wear on you though that one of the \n     foundational ways that the framers wrote the constitution was \n     almost fear of foreign interference.\n       Alexander: That's true.\n       Todd: So, and here it is.\n       Alexander: Well, if you hooked up with Ukraine to wage war \n     on the United States, as the first Senator from Tennessee \n     did, you could be expelled, but this wasn't that. What the \n     president should have done was, if he was upset about Joe \n     Biden and his son and what they were doing in Ukraine, he \n     should've called the Attorney General and told him that and \n     let the Attorney General handle it the way they always handle \n     cases that involve public things.\n       Todd: Why you think he didn't do that?\n       Alexander: Maybe he didn't know to do it.\n       Todd: Okay. This has been a rationale that I've heard from \n     a lot of Republicans. Well boy, he's still new to this.\n       Alexander: Well, a lot of people come to Washington--\n       Todd: At what point though, is he no longer new to this?\n       Alexander: The bottom line is not an excuse. He shouldn't \n     have done it. And I said he shouldn't have done it and now I \n     think it's up to the American people to say, okay, good \n     economy, lower taxes, conservative judges, behavior that I \n     might not like, call to Ukraine. And weigh that against \n     Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and pick a president.\n       Todd: Are you at all concerned though when you seek foreign \n     interference? He does not believe he's done anything wrong. \n     That what has happened here might encourage him that he can \n     continue to do this?\n       Alexander: I don't think so. I hope not. I mean, enduring \n     an impeachment is something that nobody should like. Even the \n     president said he didn't want that on his resume. I don't \n     blame him. So, if a call like that gets you an impeachment, I \n     would think he would think twice before he did it again.\n       Todd: What example in the life of Donald Trump has he been \n     chastened?\n       Alexander: I haven't studied his life that close, but, like \n     most people who survive to make it to the Presidency, he's \n     sure of himself. But hopefully he'll look at this and say, \n     okay, that was a mistake I shouldn't have done that, \n     shouldn't have done it that way. And he'll focus on the \n     strengths of his Administration, which are considerable.\n       Todd: Abuse of power, define it.\n       Alexander: Well, that's the problem with abuse of power. As \n     Professor Dershowitz said during his argument, he had a list \n     of 40 presidents who'd been accused of abuse of power from \n     Washington to Obama. So it's too vague a standard to use to \n     impeach a president. And the founders didn't use it. I mean, \n     they said, I mean, think of what a high bar they set. They \n     said treason, bribery, high crimes or misdemeanors. And then \n     they said\n       Todd: What do you think they meant by misdemeanors? \n     Violation of a public trust.\n       Alexander: At the time they used it, misdemeanor meant a \n     different thing in Great Britain. But I think Dershowitz was \n     right. It was something akin to treason, bribery and other \n     high crimes and misdemeanors, very high. And then in addition \n     to that, two thirds of us in the Senate have to agree to \n     that, which is very hard to do, which is why we've never \n     removed a president this way in 230 years.\n       Todd: One of your other reasonings was the partisan nature \n     of the impeachment vote itself in the House. Except now we \n     are answering a partisan impeachment vote in the House with a \n     partisan, I guess, I don't know what we would call this right \n     now.\n       Alexander: Well you all it acquittal. That's what happens.\n       Todd: An acquittal, but essentially also, on how the trial \n     was run--a partisan way from\n\n\n     the trial. So, if we make bipartisanship a standard, if \n     somebody has a stranglehold on a base of a political party, \n     then what you're saying is, you can overcome any impeachable \n     offense as long as you have this stranglehold on a group of \n     people.\n       Alexander: Well, as far as what the Senate did, I thought \n     we gave a good hearing to the case. I mean, I help make sure \n     that we didn't dismiss it. We heard it. There were some who \n     wanted to dismiss it. I helped make sure that we had a right \n     to ask for more evidence if we needed it, which we thought we \n     didn't. We heard, we saw videotapes of 192 times that \n     witnesses testified. We sat there for 11 and 12 hour days for \n     nine days. So, I think we heard the case pretty well, but the \n     partisan points, the most important point to me, James \n     Madison, others thought there never, ever should be a wholly \n     partisan impeachment. And if you look at Nixon, when the vote \n     that authorized that inquiry was 410 to four and you look at \n     Trump, where not a single Republican voted for it. If you \n     start out with a partisan impeachment, you're almost destined \n     to have a partisan acquittal.\n       Todd: Alright, but what do you do if you have somebody who \n     has the ability to essentially be a populist? You know, be \n     somebody who is able to say it's fake news. It's deep state. \n     Don't trust this. Don't trust that. The establishment is \n     doing this. And so don't worry about truth anymore. Don't \n     worry about what you hear over there. I mean, some may say \n     I'm painting an accurate picture. Some may be saying I'm \n     painting a radical picture. But how do you prevent that?\n       Alexander: Well, the way you prevent that in our system, \n     according to the Declaration of Independence, is we have duly \n     elected presidents with the consent of the governed. So we \n     vote them out of office. The other thing we do is, as in the \n     Nixon case, Nixon had just been elected big in 1972 big time, \n     only lost only one state, I think. But then a consensus \n     developed, a bipartisan consensus, that what he was doing was \n     wrong. And then when they found the crimes, he only had 10 or \n     12 votes that would have kept him in the Senate. So he quit. \n     So those are the two options you have.\n       Todd: Have we essentially eliminated impeachment as a tool \n     for a first-term president?\n       Alexander: No, I don't think so. I think impeachment as a \n     tool should be rarely used and it's never been used in 230 \n     years to remove a president. There been 63 impeachments, \n     eight convictions. They're all federal judges on a lower \n     standard.\n       Todd: Does it bother you that the president's lead lawyer, \n     Pat Cipollone, is now fingered as being in the room with John \n     Bolton the first time the president asked John Bolton to call \n     the new President of Ukraine and have him take a meeting with \n     Rudy Giuliani? And I say that because Pat Cipollone is up \n     there arguing that there's no direct evidence and yet, he may \n     have been a firsthand witness.\n       Alexander: Well, it doesn't have anything to do with my \n     decision because my decision was, did the president do it, \n     what he's charged with? He wasn't charged with a crime. He \n     was charged with two things. And my conclusion was, he did do \n     that and I don't need any more evidence to prove it. That \n     doesn't have anything to do with where Cipollone was.\n       Todd: No, I say that does it only reinforce what some \n     believe is that the White House was disingenuous about this \n     the whole time. They've been disingenuous about how they've \n     handled subpoenas from the House or requests from the House.\n       Alexander: I don't agree with that Chuck, either. The fact \n     of the matter is in the Nixon case, the House voted 410 to \n     four to authorize an inquiry. That means that it authorized \n     subpoenas by the judiciary committee for impeachment. This \n     House never did that. And so, all the subpoenas that they \n     asked for were not properly authorized. That's the reason \n     that the president didn't respond to them.\n       Todd: Bill Clinton offered regret for his behavior. This \n     president has not. Does that bother you?\n       Alexander: Well, there hasn't been a vote yet either, so \n     we'll see what he says and does. I think that's up to him.\n       Todd: You're comfortable acquitting him before he says \n     something of regret. Would that not, would that not help make \n     your acquittal vote?\n       Alexander: Well, I wasn't asked to decide who says his \n     level of regret. I was asked, did he make a phone call and \n     did he, at least in part, hold up aid in order to influence \n     an investigation of Joe Biden? I concluded yes. So I don't \n     need to assess his level of regret. What I hope he would do \n     is when he makes his State of the Union address, that he puts \n     this completely behind him, never mentions it and talks about \n     what he thinks he's done for the country and where we're \n     headed. He's got a pretty good story to tell. If he'll focus \n     on it.\n       Todd: You're one of the few people that detailed what you \n     believe he did wrong. One of the few Republicans that have \n     accepted the facts as they were presented. Mitt Romney was \n     just uninvited from CPAC. Mike Pompeo can't speak freely in \n     talking about Maria Bonovich, the ousted ambassador. Is there \n     room for dissent in the Republican party right now?\n       Alexander: Well, I believe there is. I mean, I dissent when \n     I need to. Whether it's on--\n       Todd: --not easy though right now, is it?\n       Alexander: Well, I voted in a way that not everybody \n     appreciated on immigration. Just before I was reelected, I \n     voted against the president's decision to use what I thought \n     was unauthorized money to build a wall, even though I think \n     we need the wall. I said, I thought he did it this past week \n     and we'll vote to acquit him. So I'm very comfortable saying \n     what I believe. And I think others can as well.\n       Todd: You know, in that phone call, there's one thing on \n     the phone call that I'm surprised frankly, hasn't been \n     brought up more by others. It's the mere mention of the word, \n     CrowdStrike is a Russian intelligence sort of piece of \n     propaganda that they've been circulating. Does it bother you \n     that the President of United States is reiterating Russian \n     propaganda?\n       Alexander: Yes. I think that's a mistake. I mean if you, \n     see what's happening in the Baltic States where Russians have \n     a big warehouse in St. Petersburg in Russia where they're \n     devoted to destabilizing Western democracies. I mean, for \n     example, in one of the Baltic States, they accused a NATO \n     officer of raping a local girl--of course it didn't happen, \n     but it threw the government in a complete disarray for a \n     week. So I think we need to be sensitive to the fact that the \n     Russians are out to do no good to destabilize Western \n     democracies, including us. And be very wary of theories that \n     Russians come up with and peddle.\n       Todd: Well, I was just going to say this, is it not \n     alarming? The President of United States in this phone call \n     and you clearly are judging him on the phone, more so than,\n       Alexander: Well the phone call and the evidence. There was \n     plenty of evidence. I mean the House managers came to us and \n     said, we have overwhelming evidence. We have a mountain of \n     evidence and we approve it beyond a shadow of a doubt. Which \n     made me think, well then why do you need more evidence?\n       Todd: Do you think it's more helpful for the public to hear \n     from John Bolton?\n       Alexander: They'll read his book in two weeks.\n       Todd: You don't want to see him testify.\n       Alexander: Well, if the question is do I need more evidence \n     to think the president did it, the answer is no. I guess I'm \n     coming back to this issue--if you looked at it as an isolated \n     incident, here he is using Russian propaganda in order to try \n     to talk to this new president of Ukraine. That's alarming. \n     Where is he getting this CrowdStrike propaganda. My view is \n     that that is Russian propaganda. Maybe he has information \n     that I didn't have.\n       Todd: Okay. Are you definitely voting to acquit or do you \n     think you may vote present?\n       Alexander: No question. I'm going to vote to acquit. I'm \n     very concerned about any action that we could take that would \n     establish a perpetual impeachment in the House of \n     Representatives whenever the House was a different party than \n     the president. That would immobilize the Senate. You know, we \n     have to take those articles, stop what we're doing, sit in \n     our chairs for 11 hours a day for three or four weeks and \n     consider it. And it would immobilize the presidency. So I \n     don't want a situation--and the framers didn't either--where \n     a partisan majority in the house of either party can stop the \n     government.\n       Todd: You used the phrase ``pour gasoline on a fire.''\n       Alexander: Yeah.\n       Todd: It certainly struck home with me reading you saying \n     something that I've been thinking long and hard about. How \n     concerned are you about the democracy as it stands right now?\n       Alexander: Well, I'm concerned and I want to give credit to \n     Marco Rubio because that's really his phrase. I borrowed it \n     from him--pouring gasoline on the cultural fires.\n       Todd: He went a step further. He said this was an \n     impeachable offense, but he was uncomfortable in an election \n     year.\n       Alexander: But, I'm concerned about the divisions in the \n     country. They're reflected in the Senate. They make it harder \n     to get a result. I mean, I work pretty hard to get results on \n     healthcare, making it easier to go to college. And we've had \n     some real success with it. But the Senate is for the purpose \n     of solving big problems that the country will accept. And \n     that goes back to what happened this past week. The country \n     would not have accepted the Senate saying to it, you can't \n     vote for or against President Trump in the Iowa caucus, New \n     Hampshire primary, or the election this year.\n       Todd: Are you glad you're leaving?\n       Alexander: No, I've really loved being in the Senate, but \n     it's time for me to go on, turn the page, think of something \n     else to do. It'll be my third permanent retirement.\n       Todd: You've retired a few times, is this one going to \n     stick?\n       Alexander: Well, we'll see.\n       Todd: Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican from Tennessee, \n     our always thoughtful guest.

It's the ``Break Glass in Case of \n     Emergency'' provision of the Constitution.\n       I plan to vote against removing the president, and I write \n     to explain this decision to the Nebraskans on both sides who \n     have advocated so passionately.\n       An impeachment trial requires senators to carry out two \n     responsibilities: We're jurors sworn to ``do impartial \n     justice.'' We're also elected officeholders responsible for \n     promoting the civic welfare of the country. We must consider \n     both the facts before us, and the long-term effects of the \n     verdict rendered. I believe removal is the wrong decision.\n       Let's start with the facts of the case. It's clear that the \n     president had mixed motives in his decision to temporarily \n     withhold military aid from Ukraine. The line between personal \n     and public was not firmly safeguarded. But it is important to \n     understand, whether one agrees with him or not, three things \n     President Trump believes:\n       He believes foreign aid is almost always a bad deal for \n     America. I don't believe this, but he has maintained this \n     position consistently since the 1980s.\n       He believes the American people need to know the 2016 \n     election was legitimate, and he believes it's dangerous if \n     they worry Russia picked America's president. About this, \n     he's right.\n       He believes the Crowdstrike theory of 2016, that Ukraine \n     conducted significant meddling in our election. I don't \n     believe this theory, but the president has heard it \n     repeatedly from people he trusts, chiefly Rudy Giuliani, and \n     he believes it.\n       These beliefs have consequences. When the president spoke \n     to Ukraine's president Zelensky in July 2019, he seems to \n     have believed he was doing something that was simultaneously \n     good for America, and good for himself politically--namely, \n     reinforcing the legitimacy of his 2016 victory. It is worth \n     remembering that that phone call occurred just days after \n     Robert Mueller's two-year investigation into the 2016 \n     election concluded that ``the investigation did not establish \n     that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated \n     with the Russian government in its election interference \n     activities.''\n       This is not a blanket excuse, of course. Some of the \n     president's lawyers have admitted that the way the \n     administration conducted policymaking toward Ukraine was \n     wrong. I agree. The call with Zelensky was certainly not \n     ``perfect,'' and the president's defense was made weaker by \n     staking out that unrepentant position.\n       Moreover, Giuliani's off-the-books foreign policy-making is \n     unacceptable, and his role in walking the president into this \n     airplane propeller is underappreciated: His Crowdstrike \n     theory was a bonkers attempt not only to validate Trump's \n     2016 election, and to flip the media's narrative of Russian \n     interference, but also to embarrass a possible opponent. One \n     certainty from this episode is that America's Mayor shouldn't \n     be any president's lawyer. It's time for the president and \n     adults on his team to usher Rudy off the stage--and to ensure \n     that we do not normalize rogue foreign policy conducted by \n     political operatives with murky financial interests.\n       There is no need to hear from any 18th impeachment witness, \n     beyond the 17 whose testimony the Senate reviewed, to confirm \n     facts we already know. Even if one concedes that John \n     Bolton's entire testimony would support Adam Schiff's \n     argument, this doesn't add to the reality already \n     established: The aid delay was wrong.\n       But in the end, the president wasn't seduced by the most \n     malign voices; his honest advisers made sure Ukraine got the \n     aid the law required. And importantly, this happened three \n     weeks before the legal deadline. To repeat: The president's \n     official staff repeatedly prevailed upon him, Ukraine \n     ultimately got the money, and no political investigation was \n     initiated or announced.\n       You don't remove a president for initially listening to bad \n     advisors but eventually taking counsel from better advisors--\n     which is precisely what happened here.\n       There is another prudential question, though, beyond the \n     facts of the case: What is the right thing for the long-term \n     civic health of our country? Will America be more stable in \n     2030 if the Senate--nine months from Election Day 2020--\n     removes the president?\n       In our Constitution's 232 years, no president has ever been \n     removed from office by the Senate. Today's debate comes at a \n     time when our institutions of self-government are suffering a \n     profound crisis of legitimacy, on both sides of the aisle. \n     This is not a new crisis since 2016; its sources run much \n     deeper and longer.\n       We need to shore up trust. A reckless removal would do the \n     opposite, setting the nation on fire. Half of the citizenry--\n     tens of millions who intended to elect a disruptive \n     outsider--would conclude that D.C. insiders overruled their \n     vote, overturned an election and struck their preferred \n     candidate from the ballot.\n       This one-party removal attempt leaves America more bitterly \n     divided. It makes it more likely that impeachment, intended \n     as a tool of last resort for the most serious presidential \n     crimes, becomes just another bludgeon in the bag of tricks \n     for the party out of power. And more Americans will conclude \n     that constitutional self-government today is nothing more \n     than partisan bloodsport.\n       We must do better. Our kids deserve better. Most of the \n     restoration and healing will happen far from Washington, of \n     course. But this week, senators have an important role: Get \n     out of the way, and allow the American people to render their \n     verdict on election day.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 19}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "Mr. SASSE", "text": "  Mr. SASSE.

Mr. President, when the Framers wrote the Constitution, \nthey didn't think someone like me would serve as a U.S. Senator, but \nthey did envision someone like Donald Trump being President of the \nUnited States, someone who thinks he is above the law and that rules \ndon't apply to him. So they made sure our democracy had the tool of \nimpeachment to stop that kind of abuse of power.\n  The House managers have clearly laid out a compelling case and \nevidence of Donald Trump's misconduct. They have shown that the \nPresident of the United States of America withheld military aid and a \ncoveted White House meeting for his political gain. He wanted a foreign \ncountry to announce--not actually conduct, announce--an investigation \ninto his political rivals. Then he refused to comply with congressional \ninvestigations into his misconduct. Unfortunately, a majority of U.S. \nSenators, even those who concede that what Donald Trump did was wrong, \nare nonetheless going to refuse to hold him accountable.\n  The Senate trial of Donald Trump has been a miscarriage of justice. \nDonald Trump is going to get away with abusing his position of power \nfor personal gain, abusing his position of power to stop Congress from \nlooking into his misconduct and falsely claim he has been exonerated. \nHe is going to escape accountability because a majority of Senators \nhave decided to let him. They voted repeatedly to block key evidence \nlike witnesses and documents that could have shed light on the full \ntruth.\n  We must recognize that still in America there are two systems of \njustice--one for the powerful and another for everyone else. So let's \nspeak the truth about what our two systems of justice actually mean in \nthe real world. It means that in our country too many people walk into \ncourthouses and face systemic bias. Too often they lack adequate legal \nrepresentation, whether they are overworked, underpaid, or both. It \nmeans that a young man named Emmett Till was falsely accused and then \nmurdered, but his murderer didn't have to spend a day in jail. It means \nthat four young Black men have their lives taken and turned upside-down \nafter being falsely accused of a crime in Groveland, FL. It means that, \nright now, too many people in America are sitting in jail without \nhaving yet been convicted of a crime but simply because they cannot \nafford bail. And it means that future Presidents of the United States \nwill remember that the U.S. Senate failed to hold Donald Trump \naccountable, and they will be emboldened to abuse their power knowing \nthere will be no consequence.\n  Donald Trump knows all this better than anybody. He may not \nacknowledge that we have two systems of justice, but he knows the \ninstitutions in this country, be it the courts or the Senate, are set \nup to protect powerful people like him. He told us as much when, \nregarding the sexual assault of women, he said, ``When you're a star, \nthey let you do it. You can do anything.'' He said that article II of \nthe U.S. Constitution gives him, as President, the right to do whatever \nhe wants.\n  Trump has shown us through his words and actions that he thinks he is \nabove the law. And when the American people see the President acting as \nthough he is above the law, it understandably leaves them feeling \ndistrustful of our system of justice, distrustful of our democracy. \nWhen the U.S. Senate refuses to hold him accountable, it reinforces \nthat loss of trust in our system.\n  Now, I am under no illusion that this body is poised to hold this \nPresident accountable, but despite the conduct of the U.S. Senate in \nthis impeachment trial, the American people must continue to strive \ntoward the more perfect Union that our Constitution promises. It is \ngoing to take all of us--in every State, every town, everywhere--to \ncontinue fighting for the best of who we\n\n\nare as a country. We each have an important role to play in fighting \nfor those words inscribed on the U.S. Supreme Court building: ``Equal \nJustice Under Law.''\n  Frederick Douglass, who I, like many, consider to be one of the \nFounders of our Nation, wrote that ``the whole history of the progress \nof human liberty shows that all concessions yet made to her august \nclaims have been born of earnest struggle.''\n  The impeachment of Donald Trump has been one of those earnest \nstruggles for liberty, and this fight, like so many before it, has been \na fight against tyranny. This struggle has not been an easy one, and it \nhas left too many people across our Nation feeling cynical. For too \nmany people, this trial confirmed something they have always known, \nthat the real power in this country lies not with them but with just a \nfew people who advance their own interests at the expense of others' \nneeds. For many, the injustice in this trial is yet another example of \nthe way that our system of justice has worked or, more accurately, \nfailed to work.\n  But here is the thing. Frederick Douglass also told us that ``if \nthere is no struggle, there is no progress.'' He went on to say: \n``Power concedes nothing without a demand.'' And he said: ``It never \ndid, and it never will.''\n  In order to wrestle power away from the few people at the very top \nwho abuse their power, the American people are going to have to fight \nfor the voice of the people and the power of the people. We must go \ninto the darkness to shine a light, and we cannot be deterred and we \ncannot be overwhelmed and we cannot ever give up on our country.\n  We cannot ever give up on the ideals that are the foundation for our \nsystem of democracy. We can never give up on the meaning of true \njustice. And it is part of our history, our past, clearly, our present, \nand our future that, in order to make these values real, in order to \nmake the promise of our country real, we can never take it for granted.\n  There will be moments in time, in history, where we experience \nincredible disappointment, but the greatest disappointment of all will \nbe if we give up. We cannot ever give up fighting for who we know we \nare, and we must always see who we can be, unburdened by who we have \nbeen. That is the strength of our Nation.\n  So, after the Senate votes today, Donald Trump will want the American \npeople to feel cynical. He will want us not to care. He will want us to \nthink that he is all powerful and we have no power, but we are not \ngoing to let him get away with that.\n  We are not going to give him what he wants because the true power and \npotential of the United States of America resides not with the \nPresident but with the people--all the people.\n  So, in our long struggle for justice, I will do my part by voting to \nconvict this lawless President and remove him from office, and I urge \nmy colleagues to join me on the right side of history.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 12, "speaker_bioguide": "H001075", "itemno": 22}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "The PRESIDING OFFICER", "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, considering whether to convict a President \nof the United States on Articles of Impeachment is a solemn and \nconsequential duty, and I do not take it lightly. Even before we had a \ncountry, our Founders put forward the notion of ``country first,'' \npledging in the Declaration of Independence their lives, fortunes, and \nsacred honor--a pledge they made to an idea, imagining and hoping for a \ncountry where no one was above the law, where no one had absolute \npower.\n  My dad, a World War II veteran, and my mom raised me to understand \nthat this is what made our country the unique and indispensable \ndemocracy that it is.\n  My obligation throughout this process has been to listen carefully to \nthe case that the House managers put forward and the defenses asserted \nby the President's lawyers, and then to carefully consider the \nconstitutional basis for impeachment, the intent of our Founders, and \nthe facts.\n  That is what I have done over the past few days. The Senate heard \nextensive presentations from both sides and answers to the almost 200 \nquestions that Senators posed to the House managers and the President's \nadvocates.\n  The facts clearly showed that President Trump abused the public's \nsacred trust by using taxpayer dollars to extort a foreign government \ninto providing misinformation about a feared political opponent.\n  Let me repeat that. The President of the United States used taxpayer \nmoney that had been authorized, obligated, and cleared for delivery as \ncritical military aid to Ukraine to try to force that country to \ninterfere in our elections. He violated the law and the public trust. \nAnd he put our national security, and the lives of the Ukrainian \nsoldiers on the frontlines of Russian aggression at risk.\n  Although the country was alerted to the possibility that the \nPresident had crossed a critical line because of revelations about his \nnow-infamous July 25 phone call, it is not the phone call alone that \nled to the President's impeachment. Instead, the phone call was a \npivotal point in a scheme that had started earlier, spearheaded by \nPresident Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n  Mr. Giuliani has acknowledged that he was doing the President's \npersonal and political bidding when he engaged with the Ukrainian \ngovernment.\n  As the newly elected anti-corruption Ukrainian Government came into \npower, in need of recognition and support from the United States, \nPresident Trump forced officials from Ukraine and the United States to \nnegotiate through Mr. Giuliani, conflating his personal and political \ninterests with the national security and diplomatic interests of our \ncountry.\n  And then, as President Zelensky resisted the request that he concoct \nand announce a fake investigation into the Bidens, the President and \nMr. Giuliani increased the pressure. Suddenly, and without explanation \nor a legally required notification to Congress, the President ordered \nthat previously approved and critically needed military aid to Ukraine \nbe held up.\n  Mr. Trump, at first through Mr. Giuliani, and then directly, \nsolicited interference with an American election from a foreign \ngovernment. And he ordered others in his administration to work with \nMr. Giuliani to ensure this scheme's success.\n  While there is still more evidence that the Senate should have \nsubpoenaed both witnesses and documents that would have given us a more \ncomplete understanding of what happened, we know as much as we do \nbecause of the courage and strength of American patriots who put \ncountry before self--patriots like the intelligence community \nwhistleblower, who was followed by Army Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, and \nformer U.S. Ambassadors to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and William \nTaylor, as well as current members of the administration.\n  These Americans who came forward were doing exactly what we always \nask of citizens: If you see something wrong, you need to speak up; \n``See something, say something.'' It is a fundamental part of \ncitizenship to alert each other to danger, to act for the greater good, \nto care about each other and our country without regard to political \nparty.\n  When Americans step forward, sometimes at real risk to themselves, \nthey rightly expect that their government will take the information \nthey provide and act to make them safer, to protect their fundamental \nrights. That is the understanding between the American people and their \nrepresentative government.\n  While the brave women and men who appeared before the House did their \njobs, the Senate, under this majority, has unfortunately not. Rather \nthan gathering full, relevant testimony under oath and with the benefit \nof cross-examination, the Senate majority has apparently decided that \ndespite what it has heard, it is not interested in learning more; not \ninterested in learning more about how a President, his personal agent, \nand members of his administration corrupted our foreign policy and put \nour Nation's security at risk; not interested in learning more about \nhow they planned to use the power of his office to tilt the scales of \nthe next election to ensure that he stays in power; not interested in \nlearning more about how they worked to cover it up.\n  Increasingly, over the last few days, the President's defense team \nand more and more of my colleagues in the Senate have acknowledged the \nfacts of the\n\n\nPresident's scheme. Their argument has shifted from ``He didn't do it'' \nto ``He had a right to,'' to ``He won't do it again,'' or even ``It \ndoesn't really matter.''\n  I disagree so strongly.\n  The idea that in our country, established by the very rejection of a \nmonarchy, the President has absolute power is absurd, as is the idea \nthat this President, whose conduct is ultimately the cause of this \nentire process, will suddenly stop. President Trump continues to invite \nforeign powers to interfere with our elections, maintaining to this day \nthat ``it was a perfect call.''\n  Our Founders knew that all people, all leaders, are fallible human \nbeings. And they knew that our system of checks and balances could \nsurvive some level of human frailty, even in as important an office as \nthe Presidency.\n  The one thing that they feared it could not survive was a President \nwho would put self-interest before the interests of the American people \nor who didn't understand the difference between the two. As citizen-in-\nchief, and one wielding enormous power, Presidents must put country \nfirst.\n  Our Founders knew that we needed a mechanism to hold Presidents \naccountable for behavior that violated that basic understanding and \nthat would threaten our democracy. And they provided a mechanism for \nremoval outside of the election process because of the immense damage a \nPresident could do in the time between elections--damage, in the case \nof this President's continuing behavior, to our national security and \nelection integrity.\n  Our Founders believed that they were establishing a country that \nwould be unique in the history of humankind, a country that would be \nindispensable, built on the rule of law, not the whims of a ruler. \nGeneration after generation of Americans have fought for that vision \nbecause of what it has meant to our individual and collective success \nand to the progress of humankind worldwide.\n  That is the America that I have sworn an oath to protect.

Mr. President, on the day I was sworn in as a United \nStates Senator, I took an oath to protect and defend the Constitution. \nJust last month, at the beginning of the impeachment trial, I took a \nsecond oath to do fair and impartial justice, according to the same \nConstitution I swore to protect.\n  As I took the oath and throughout the impeachment trial, I couldn't \nhelp but think of my father. As many of you know, I lost my dad over \nthe holiday recess. While so many were arguing over whether or not the \nSpeaker of the House should send Articles of Impeachment to the Senate, \nI was struggling with watching him slip away, while only occasionally \ntrying to weigh in with my voice to be heard about the need for \nwitnesses in the upcoming impeachment trial. My dad was a great man, a \nloving husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather who did his \nbest to instill in me the values of right and wrong as I grew up in \nFairfield, AL. He was also a fierce patriot who loved this country. \nAlthough, fortunately, he was never called on to do so, I firmly \nbelieve he would have placed his country even above his family because \nhe knew and understood fully what America and the freedoms and \nliberties that come with her mean to everyone in this great country \nand, significantly, to people around the world.\n  I know he would have put his country before any allegiance to any \npolitical party or even to any President. He was on the younger side of \nthat ``greatest generation'' who joined the Navy at age 17 to serve our \ngreat military. That service and love of country shaped him into the \nman of principle that he was, instilling in me those same principles. \nIn thinking of him, his patriotism, his principles, and how he raised \nme, I am reminded of Robert Kennedy's words that were mentioned in this \ntrial:\n\n       Few men are willing to brave the disapproval of their \n     fellows, the censure of their colleagues, the wrath of their \n     society. Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in \n     battle or great intelligence. Yet it is the one essential, \n     vital quality for those who seek to change a world that \n     yields most painfully to change.\n\n  Candidly, to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I fear that \nmoral courage, country before party is a rare commodity these days. We \ncan write about it and talk about it in speeches and in the media, but \nit is harder to put into action when political careers may be on the \nline. Nowhere is the dilemma more difficult than in an impeachment of \nthe President of the United States. Very early on in this process, I \nimplored my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, in both Houses of \nCongress, to stay out of their political and partisan corners. Many \ndid, but so many did not. Even the media continually view this entire \nprocess through partisan, political eyes and how it may or may not \naffect an election. That is unfortunate. The country deserves better, \nand we must find a way to move beyond such partisan divides.\n  The solemn oaths that I have taken have been my guides during what \nhas been a difficult time for the country, my State, and for me \npersonally. I did not run for the Senate hoping to participate in the \nimpeachment trial of a duly elected President, but I cannot and will \nnot shrink from my duty to defend the Constitution and to do impartial \njustice.\n  In keeping with my oath as Senator and my oath to do impartial \njustice, I resolved that throughout this process, I would keep an open \nmind, to consider the evidence without regard to political affiliation, \nand to hear all of the evidence before making a final decision on \neither charge against the President. I believe that my votes later \ntoday will reflect that commitment.\n  With the eyes of history upon us, I am acutely aware of the \nprecedents that this impeachment trial will set for future Presidencies \nand Congresses. Unfortunately, I do not believe that those precedents \nare good ones. I am particularly concerned that we have now set a \nprecedent that the Senate does not have to go forward with witnesses or \nreview documents, even when those witnesses have firsthand information \nand the documents would allow us to test not just the credibility of \nwitnesses but also test the words of counsel of both parties.\n  It is my firm belief that the American people deserve more. In short, \nwitnesses and documents would provide the Senate and the American \npeople with a more complete picture of the truth. I believe the \nAmerican people deserve nothing less.\n  That is not to say, however, that there is not sufficient evidence in \nwhich to render a judgment. There is. As a trial lawyer, I once \nexplained this process to a jury as like putting together the pieces of \na puzzle. When you open the box and spread all the pieces on the table, \nit is just an incoherent jumble. But one by one, you hold those pieces \nup, and you hold them next to each other and see what fits and what \ndoesn't. Even if, as was often the case in my house growing up, you are \nmissing a few pieces--even important ones--you more often than not see \nthe picture.\n  As I have said many times, I believe the American people deserve to \nsee a completed puzzle, a picture with all of the pieces--pieces in the \nform of documents and witnesses with relevant, firsthand information, \nwhich would have provided valuable context, corroboration, or \ncontradiction to that which we have heard. But even with missing \npieces, our common sense and life's experiences allow us to see the \npicture as it comes into full view.\n  Throughout the trial, one piece of evidence continued to stand out \nfor me. It was the President's statement that under the Constitution, \n``we have Article II, and I can do anything I want.'' That seems to \ncapture this President's belief about the Presidency; that he has \nunbridled power, unchecked by Congress or the Judiciary or anyone \nelse. That view, dangerous as it is, explains the President's actions \ntoward Ukraine and Congress.\n\n  The sum of what we have seen and heard is, unfortunately, a picture \nof a President who has abused the great power of his office for \npersonal gain--a picture of a President who has placed his personal \ninterest well above the interests of the Nation and, in so doing,\n\n\nthreatened our national security, the security of our European allies, \nand the security of Ukraine. The evidence clearly proves that the \nPresident used the weight of his office and the weight of the U.S. \nGovernment to seek to coerce a foreign government to interfere in our \nelection for his personal political benefit. His actions were more than \nsimply inappropriate; they were an abuse of power.\n  When I was a lawyer for the Alabama Judicial Inquiry Commission, \nthere was a saying that the chairman of the inquiry commission and one \nof Alabama's great judges, Randall Cole, used to say about judges who \nstrayed from the canons of ethics. He would say that the judge ``left \nhis post.''\n  Sadly, President Trump left his post with regard to the withholding \nof military aid to Ukraine and a White House visit for the new \nUkrainian President, and in so doing, he took the great powers of the \nOffice of the President of the United States with him. Impeachment is \nthe only check on such Presidential wrongdoing.\n  The second article of impeachment, obstruction of Congress, gave me \nmore pause. I have struggled to understand the House's strategy in \ntheir failure to fully pursue documents and witnesses and wished that \nthey had done more. However, after careful consideration of the \nevidence developed in the hearings, the public disclosures, the legal \nprecedents, and the trial, I believe that the President deliberately \nand unconstitutionally obstructed Congress by refusing to cooperate \nwith the investigation in any way. While I am sensitive to protecting \nthe privileges and immunities afforded to the President and his \nadvisers, I believe it is critical to our constitutional structure that \nwe also protect the authorities of the Congress of the United States. \nHere it was clear from the outset that the President had no intention \nwhatsoever of accommodating Congress when he blocked both witnesses and \ndocuments from being produced. In addition, he engaged in a course of \nconduct to threaten potential witnesses and smear the reputations of \nthe civil servants who did come forward and provide testimony.\n  The President's actions demonstrate a belief that he is above the \nlaw, that Congress has no power whatsoever in questioning or examining \nhis actions, and that all who do so, do so at their peril. That belief, \nunprecedented in the history of this country, simply must not be \npermitted to stand. To do otherwise risks guaranteeing that no future \nwhistleblower or witness will ever come forward, and no future \nPresident, Republican or Democrat, will be subject to congressional \noversight as mandated by the Constitution even when the President has \nso clearly abused his office and violated the public trust.\n  Accordingly, I will vote to convict the President on both Articles of \nImpeachment. In doing so, I am mindful that in a democracy there is \nnothing more sacred than the right to vote and respecting the will of \nthe people. But I am also mindful that when our Founders wrote the \nConstitution, they envisioned a time or at least a possibility that our \ndemocracy would be more damaged if we fail to impeach and remove a \nPresident. Such is the moment in history that we face today.\n  The gravity of this moment, the seriousness of the charges, and the \nimplication for future Presidencies and Congress have all contributed \nto the difficulty at which I arrived at my decision.\n  I am mindful that I am standing at a desk that once was used by John \nF. Kennedy, who famously wrote ``Profiles in Courage,'' and there will \nbe so many who simply look at what I am doing today and say that it is \na profile in courage. It is not. It is simply a matter of right and \nwrong, where doing right is not a courageous act; it is simply \nfollowing your oath.\n  This has been a divisive time for our country, but I think it has \nnonetheless been an important constitutional process for us to follow. \nAs this chapter of history draws to a close, one thing is clear to me. \nAs I have said before, our country deserves better than this. They \ndeserve better from the President, and they deserve better from the \nCongress. We must find a way to come together, to set aside partisan \ndifferences, and to focus on what we have in common as Americans.\n  While so much is going in our favor these days, we still face great \nchallenges, both domestically and internationally. But it remains my \nfirm belief that united we can conquer them and remain the greatest \nhope for the people around the world.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 16, "speaker_bioguide": "J000300", "itemno": 26}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "The PRESIDING OFFICER", "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today the Senate is called upon to uphold \nour oath of office and our duty to the Constitution because President \nTrump failed to do so himself.\n  After listening closely to the impeachment managers and the \nPresident's defense team, weighing the evidence that was presented to \nus, and being denied the opportunity to see relevant documents and hear \nfrom firsthand witnesses, I will vote to find President Trump guilty on \nboth Articles of Impeachment.\n  I take no pleasure in voting to impeach a President and remove him \nfrom office. I agree with those who say that impeachment should be rare \nand American voters should decide our elections. That is why it is so \ngalling that President Trump blatantly solicited foreign interference \nin our democratic process. And he did it as he geared up for \nreelection.\n  The evidence shows President Trump deliberately and illicitly sought \nforeign help to manufacture a scandal that would elevate him by \ntarnishing a political rival.\n  He attempted to undermine our democracy, using U.S. taxpayer money in \nthe form of U.S. military aid for Ukraine as leverage for his own \npersonal benefit. The President's aides who heard President Trump's \ncall seeking ``a favor'' from the Ukrainian President immediately \nsensed it was wrong. So when they alerted the White House lawyers, the \nrecord of the call was immediately placed on a highly classified \ncomputer system. And despite the President claiming that the version of \nthe call that was publicly released ``is an exact word-for-word \ntranscript of the conversation,'' we know from testimony that there are \nkey omissions in the document we all read.\n  Compounding the President's misconduct, he then engaged in an \nextended cover up that appears to be ongoing to this day.\n  There is a lot to unravel here, and I will provide a more detailed \nlegal explanation in the near future. But for now, let me briefly \nexplain my decision and outline my thoughts on the Senate's impeachment \nproceedings and the disturbing precedents I fear will be set when the \nmajority chooses to side with the President over the Constitution's \nchecks and balances.\n  The House of Representatives voted to impeach the President for abuse \nof power and obstruction of Congress. Based on the uncontested \nevidence, I concur.\n  It is clear that President Trump and others, such as Mr. Giuliani, \nwho was serving as the President's lawyer, attempted to coerce the \nnewly elected President of Ukraine to announce two sham investigations, \nincluding one that sought to directly damage President Trump's rival in \nthe upcoming election. The President's actions served his personal and \npolitical needs, not those of our country. His efforts to withhold \nmilitary aid to Ukraine for his own personal benefit undermined our \nnational security.\n  The second article of impeachment charges the President with \nobstruction of Congress for blocking testimony and refusing to provide \ndocuments in response to House subpoenas in the impeachment inquiry. \nAgain, the House managers produced overwhelming evidence of the \nPresident's obstruction and his efforts to cover up his malfeasance.\n  The President's counsel offered a number of unpersuasive arguments \nagainst this article, which fail to overcome the following: first, that \nthe legislative branch has sole power over impeachment under the \nConstitution. That could not be more clear; second, past precedents of \nprior administrations and court rulings; and third, the blatant October \n8 letter expressing a complete rejection of the House's impeachment \nproceedings.\n  The Constitution grants the executive branch significant power, but \nas every student in America learns, our system is one of checks and \nbalances so that no branch is entirely unfettered from oversight and \nthe law.\n\n\n  President Trump would have us believe this system of checks and \nbalances is wrong. In President Trump's own words, he expressed the \nmisguided imperial belief in the supremacy of his unchecked power, \nstating, quote: ``I have an Article II, where I have the right to do \nwhatever I want as President.''\n  Couple this sentiment with his January 2016 boast that, quote: ``I \ncould stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I \nwouldn't lose voters.'' That paints a chilling picture of someone who \nclearly believes, incorrectly, that he is above the law. The \nPresident's attorneys have hewn to this line of faulty reasoning and, \nin one notably preposterous effort, even claimed the President could \navoid impeachment for an inappropriate action motivated entirely by his \nown political and personal interests.\n  The President's defense also failed to sufficiently demonstrate that \nthe President's blanket defiance of subpoenas and document requests \novercomes the precedents established in prior impeachment proceedings \nand the record of congressional oversight of the executive branch.\n  In the Clinton impeachment, there was an enormous amount of \ndocumentary evidence, as well as sworn depositions and testimony by the \nPresident and his closest advisers.\n  In the cases of United States v. Nixon, House Judiciary Committee v. \nMiers, and others, the House managers rightly point out that the courts \nhave held ``Congress's power to investigate is as broad as its power to \nlegislate and lies at the heart of Congress's constitutional role.''\n  While President Trump's impeachment lawyers claim the House should \ntake the President to court over these previously settled issues, \nPresident Trump's lawyers at the Justice Department are simultaneously \narguing in the courts that the judicial branch cannot even rule on such \nmatters.\n  As President Trump staked out new, expansive, and aggressive \npositions about executive privilege, immunity, and the limits of \nCongress's oversight authority, Republican leaders went along with it.\n  I have heard a variety of explanations for why my Republican \ncolleagues voted against witnesses. But no one has offered the simplest \nexplanation: My Republican colleagues did not want to hear new evidence \nbecause they have a hunch it would be really, really bad for this \nPresident. It would further expose the depth of his wrongdoing. And it \nwould make it harder for them to vote to acquit.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle did not ask to be put in \nthis position. President Trump's misconduct forced it on them. But in \nthe partisan rush to spare President Trump from having his staff and \nformer staff publicly testify against him under oath, a bar has been \nlowered, a constitutional guardrail has been removed, the Senate has \nbeen voluntarily weakened, and our oversight powers severely \ndiminished.\n  This short-term maneuver to shield President Trump from the truth is \na severe blow against good government that will do lasting damage to \nthis institution and our democracy. I hope one day the damage can be \nrepaired.\n  The arc of history is indeed long, and it does bend toward justice--\nbut not today. Today, the Senate and the American people have been \ndenied access to relevant, available evidence and firsthand witnesses. \nWe have been prohibited from considering new, material information that \nbecame available after the House's impeachment vote.\n  The Constitution is our national compass. But at this critical \nmoment, clouded by the fog of President Trump's misconduct, the Senate \nmajority has lost its way, and is no longer guided by the Constitution. \nIn order to regain our moral bearings, stay true to our core values, \nand navigate a better path forward, we must hold President Trump \naccountable.\n  The President was wrong to invite foreign interference in our \ndemocracy. He was wrong to try and stonewall the investigation. And he \nis wrong if he thinks he is above the law.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 18, "speaker_bioguide": "R000122", "itemno": 28}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "The PRESIDING OFFICER", "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, from the first words in the \nConstitution, the weight that lies on every American's shoulders has \nbeen clear: We the people are the ones who dreamed up this wild \nexperiment that we call America, and we the people are the ones charged \nwith ensuring its survival.\n  That is the tension--the push and the pull--behind our democracy \nbecause, while there is no greater privilege than living in a country \nwhose Constitution guarantees our rights, there is no greater burden \nthan knowing that our actions could sap that very same Constitution of \nits power; that our inaction risks allowing it to wither like any other \npiece of parchment from some bygone era.\n  For the past few weeks, it has been my sworn duty as a U.S. Senator \nto sit as an impartial juror in the impeachment trial of Donald J. \nTrump. While I wish the President had not put our Nation in this \nposition, after having listened closely with an open mind to both \nsides, it is now my duty as an American to vote on whether to remove \nhim from office. Other than sending our troops into harm's way, I \ncannot think of a more serious, more somber vote to take in this \nChamber, but as sobering as it is, the right path forward is clear.\n  Throughout this trial, we have seen unprecedented obstruction from \nthe Trump administration--obstruction so flagrant that it makes Nixon, \nwhen in the thick of Watergate, look like the model of transparency. \nYet the facts uncovered still prove the truth of the matter: Trump \nabused his power when he secretly withheld security aid and a White \nHouse meeting to try to force Ukraine to announce investigations into a \npolitical rival in order to help him swing November's election. He put \nhis political self-interest ahead of our national security. He smeared \nthe name of an American Ambassador, even seemingly risking her safety \nbecause she was simply too principled to further his corruption, \nbecause she was too clean to help him strong-arm Ukraine into that \nfavor he demanded.\n  When the reports first emerged about what he had done, he denied it. \nThen his explanation changed to: Well, maybe I did do it, but it was \nonly because I was trying to root out corruption.\n  If that were true, there would be some documentary record to prove \nthat, and we have seen absolutely none, even after I asked for it \nduring the questioning period.\n  Now his defense team has gone so far as to claim that, well, it \ndoesn't matter if he did it because he is the President, and the \nPresident can do anything he wants if it will help him get reelected. \nBreathtaking. To put it another way, when he got caught, he lied. Then, \nwhen that lie was found out, he lied again, then again, then again.\n  Along the way, his own defense counsel could not papier-mache \ntogether even the most basic argument to actually exonerate him. The \nbest case they could muster boiled down to: When the President does it, \nit is not illegal. Nixon already tried that defense. It did not work \nthen, and it does not work now because--here is the thing--in America, \nwe believe not in rulers but in the rule of law.\n  Through all we have seen over the past few months, the truth has \nnever changed. It is what National Security Council officials and \ndecades-long diplomats testified to under oath. It is what foreign \npolicy experts and Trump administration staffers--and, yes, an American \nwarrior with a Purple Heart--have raised their right hands to tell us, \ntime after time, since the House hearings had begun.\n  Even some of my Republican colleagues have admitted that Trump \n``cross[ed] a line.'' Some said it as recently as this weekend, but \nmany more said months ago that, if Trump did do what he is accused of, \nthen it would, indeed, be wrong. Well, it is now obvious that those \nallegations were true, and it is pretty clear that Trump's defense team \nknows that also. If they actually believe Trump did nothing wrong--that \nhis call was ``perfect''--then why would they fight so hard to block \nthe witnesses and the documents from coming to light that could \nexonerate him? The only reason they would have done so is if they had \nknown that he was guilty. The only reason for one to vote to acquit \nTrump today is if one is OK with his trying to cover it up.\n  Now, I know that some folks have been saying that we should acquit\n\n\nhim--that we should ignore our constitutional duty and leave him in \noffice--because we are in an election year and that the voters should \ndecide his fate. That is an argument that rings hollow because this \ntrial was about Trump's trying to cheat in the next election and rob \nthe voters of their ability to decide. Any action other than voting to \nremove him would give him the license and the power to keep tampering \nwith that race, to keep trying to turn that election into as much of a \nsham as an impeachment trial without witnesses.\n  You know, I spent 23 years in the military, and one of the most \ncritical lessons anyone who serves learns is of the damage that can be \ndone when troops don't oppose illegal orders, when fealty becomes blind \nand ignorance becomes intentional. Just as it is the duty of military \nofficers to oppose unlawful orders, it is the responsibility of public \nservants to hold those in power accountable.\n  Former NSC official Fiona Hill understood that when she testified \nbefore Congress because she knew that politics must never eclipse \nnational security.\n  Ambassador Bill Taylor understood that as well. The veteran who has \nserved in every administration since Reagan's answered the question \nthat is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. He said under oath \nthat, yes, there was a ``clear understanding'' of a quid pro quo--\nexactly the sort of abuse of power no President should be allowed to \nget away with.\n  LTC Alexander Vindman--the Purple Heart recipient who dedicated \ndecades of his life to our Armed Forces--understood the lessons of the \npast, too, in his saying that, here in America, right matters.\n  My colleagues in this Chamber who have attacked Lieutenant Colonel \nVindman or who have provided a platform for others to tear him down \njust for his doing what he believes is right should be ashamed of \nthemselves.\n  We should all be aware of the example we set and always seek to \nelevate the national discourse. We should be thoughtful about our own \nconduct both in terms of respecting the rule of law and the sacrifices \nour troops make to keep us safe because, at the end of the day, our \nConstitution is really just a set of rules on some pieces of paper. It \nis only as strong as our will to uphold its ideals and hold up the \nscales of justice.\n  So I am asking each of us today to muster up just an ounce of the \ncourage shown by Fiona Hill, Ambassador Taylor, and Lieutenant Colonel \nVindman. When our names are called from the dais in a few hours, each \nof us will either pass or fail the most elementary, yet most important, \ntest any elected official will ever take--whether to put country over \nparty or party over country.\n  It may be a politically difficult vote for some of us, but it should \nnot be a morally difficult vote for any of us because, while I know \nthat voting to acquit would make the lives of some of my colleagues \nsimpler come election day, I also know that America would have never \nbeen born if the heroes of centuries past made decisions based on \npolitical expediency.\n  It would have been easier to have kept bowing down to King George III \nthan to have pushed 342 chests of tea into the Boston Harbor, and it \nwould have been easier to have kept paying taxes to the Crown than to \nhave waged a revolution. Yet those patriots knew the importance of \nrejecting what was easy if it were in conflict with what was right. \nThey knew that the courage of just a few could change history.\n  So, when it is time to vote this afternoon, we cannot think of \npolitical convenience. If we say abuse of power doesn't warrant removal \nfrom office today, we will be paving the way for future Presidents to \ndo even worse tomorrow--to keep breaking the law and to keep \nendangering our country--one ``perfect'' call, one ``favor,'' one high \ncrime and misdemeanor at a time.\n  Time and again, over these past few months, we have heard one story \nabout our Founders, perhaps, more than any other. It was the time when \nBenjamin Franklin walked out of Independence Hall after the \nConstitutional Convention and someone asked: ``What have we got--a \nrepublic or a monarchy?''\n  We all know what he said: ``A Republic if you can keep it.''\n  Keeping it may very well come down to the 100 of us in this very \nChamber. We are the ones the Constitution vests with the power to hold \nthe President accountable, and through our actions, we are the ones who \nvest the Constitution with its power.\n  In this moment, let's think not just of today but of tomorrow too. In \nthis moment, let's remember that, here, right matters; truth matters. \nThe truth is that Donald Trump is guilty of these Articles of \nImpeachment. I will vote to do the right thing, and I hope my \ncolleagues will as well.

Mr. President, later today I will vote to acquit the \nPresident on the charges of the two Articles of Impeachment. A not-\nguilty verdict, as every Senator on this floor has known for some time, \nwas always what would happen in a House-driven, partisan impeachment \nprocess.\n  Less than a year ago, the Speaker of the House said that we should \nnot go through this process unless something was compelling, unless \nsomething was overwhelming, unless something was bipartisan. I think \nthe Speaker was exactly right then, and I hope all future Speakers look \nat that guidance as we think about this process of impeachment.\n  In the first 180 years of the Constitution, individual Members talked \nabout impeachment of Presidents--maybe of almost every President--but \nthe Congress only seriously touched this topic one time--one time in \n180 years.\n  In the last 46 years, Presidential impeachment has been before the \ncountry three times, and each case has been less compelling than the \none before it. We don't want partisan impeachment to become an exercise \nthat happens when one party--not the party of the President--happens to \nhave a majority of the votes in the House of Representatives.\n  Impeachment is fundamentally a political process. The Members of the \nSenate meet no standards for a regular jury. The jury can override the \njudge. Two-thirds of the Senate is necessary to remove the President. \nWe really have no better term in the Constitution, I suppose, to use \nthan ``trial,'' but in any classic sense, this isn't a trial. In any \nclassic sense, a partisan impeachment isn't any kind of a real \nindictment.\n  Maybe, first and foremost, the House has to do its job. Part of that \njob would be to create a case that would produce a bipartisan vote on \nthe articles in the House. If you haven't met that standard--going back \nto the Speaker's standard--you should work on the case some more and \nthen wonder, if you can't meet the standard, what is wrong with the \nprocess you are going through. Part of that job is to do everything \nnecessary to have Articles of Impeachment that are compelling and \ncomplete.\n  The House has time available to it to consider impeachment as they go \nabout their essential work. They can continue to do the work of the \nCongress. They have weeks, months, if they choose to have, even maybe \nyears to put a case together. They can call witnesses. They can go to \ncourt to seek testimony. They can determine if this is an impeachment \nquestion or just an oversight question.\n  The House can do lots of things, but once the Senate gets the \nArticles of Presidential Impeachment, they become for the Senate an \nabsolute priority. Both our rules and reality mean we cannot do \nanything else, realistically, until we are done dealing with the case \nthe House sent over.\n  That was fundamentally what was so wrong with the House sending over \na case that they said needed more work. If it needed more work, it \nshould have had more work.\n  You can be for strong review of the executive. You can be for strong \ncongressional oversight and still support the idea of executive \nprivilege. The\n\n\nPresident has the right to unfettered advice and to know all the \noptions. In fact, I think when you pierce that right, you begin to have \nadvisers who may not want to give all the options to the President \nbecause it might appear they were for all the options. But the \nPresident's advisers need to see that the President understands all the \noptions and implications of a decision.\n  The President, by the way--another topic that came up here several \ntimes--the President determines executive policy. The staff, the \nassistants, and whoever else works in the executive branch doesn't \ndetermine executive policy; the President determines executive policy. \nThe staff can put all the notes in front of the President they want to, \nbut it is the President's decision what the policy of the \nadministration will be. Sharing that decision with the Congress, \nsharing how he got to that point--or later, she got to that point--with \nthat decision is a negotiated balance.\n  Congress says: We want to know this.\n  The President says: No. I need to have some ability for people to \ngive me advice that isn't all available for the Congress.\n  So this is balanced out, and if that can't happen, if that balance \ncan't be achieved, the judiciary decides what the balance is. The \njudiciary decides a question and says: You really must talk to the \nCongress about this, but you don't have to talk to them about the next \nsentence you said at that same meeting.\n  That is the kind of balance that occurs.\n  The idea repeatedly advanced by the House managers that the Senate, \nby majority vote, can decide these questions is both outrageous and \ndangerous.\n  The idea that the government would balance itself is, frankly, the \nmiracle of the Constitution. Nobody had ever proposed, until \nPhiladelphia in 1787, one, that the basis for government was the people \nthemselves, and two, you could have a government that was so finely \nbalanced that it would operate and maintain itself over time.\n  The House managers would really upend that balance. By being \nunwilling to take the time the House had to pursue the constitutional \nsolution, they decided: We don't have to worry about the Constitution \nto have that solution.\n  To charge that the President's assertion of article II rights that go \nback to Washington is one of the actual Articles of Impeachment--that \nis dangerous.\n  The legislative branch cannot also be the judicial branch. The \nlegislative branch can't also decide ``here is the balance'' if the \nexecutive and legislative branch are in a fight about what should be \ndisclosed and what shouldn't. You can't continue to have the three \nbalances of power in our government if one of the branches can decide \nwhat the legislative branch should decide.\n  In their haste to put this case together, the House sent the Senate \nthe two weakest Articles of Impeachment possible. Presidents since \nWashington have been accused by some Members of Congress of abuse of \npower. Presidents since Washington have been accused by some Members of \nCongress of failure to cooperate with the Congress.\n  The House managers argued against their own case. They repeatedly \ncontended that they had made their case completely, they had made their \ncase totally, they had made their case incontrovertibly, but they \nwanted us to call witnesses they had chosen not to call. They said they \nhad already been in court 9 months to get the President's former White \nHouse Counsel to testify and weren't done yet, but somehow they thought \nthe Senate could get that person and others in a matter of days.\n  These arguments have been and should have been rejected by the \nSenate.\n  Today, the Articles of Impeachment should be and will be rejected by \nthe Senate. Based on the Speaker's March comments, these articles \nshould have never been sent to the Senate. They were not compelling, \nthey were not overwhelming, they were not bipartisan, and most \nimportantly, they were not necessary.\n  One of the lessons we send today is to this House and to future \nHouses of Representatives: Do your job. Take it seriously. Don't make \nit political.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 24, "speaker_bioguide": "B000575", "itemno": 35}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "The PRESIDING OFFICER", "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have long maintained that most, if not all, \nof the most serious and vexing problems within our Federal Government \ncan be traced to a deviation from the twin core structural protections \nof the Constitution.\n  There are two of these protections--one that operates along a \nvertical axis; the other, a horizontal.\n  The vertical protection we call federalism, which states a very \nsimple fact: that in the American system of government, most power is \nto be reserved to the States respectively, or the people, where it is \nexercised at the State and local level. It is only those powers \nenumerated in the Constitution, either in article I, section 8 or \nelsewhere, that are made Federal, those things that the Founding \nFathers appropriately deemed unavoidably, necessarily national or that \nwe have otherwise rendered national through a subsequent constitutional \namendment.\n  As was the case when James Madison wrote Federalist No. 45, the \npowers reserved to the States are numerous and indefinite, while those \nthat are given to the Congress to be exercised federally are few and \ndefined--few and defined powers, the Federal Government; numerous and \nindefinite reserved for the States.\n  The horizontal protection operates within the Federal Government \nitself, and it acknowledges that we have three coequal, independent \nbranches within the Federal Government: one that makes the laws, one \nthat executes the laws, and one that interprets the laws when people \ncan't come to an agreement and have an active, live dispute as to the \nmeaning of a particular law in a particular case or controversy.\n  Sadly, we have drifted steadily, aggressively from both of these \nprinciples over the last 80 years. For roughly the first 150 years of \nthe founding of our Republic and of the operation of our constitutional \nstructure, we adhered pretty closely to them, but over the last 80 \nyears or so, we have drifted steadily. This has been a bipartisan \nproblem. It was one that was created under the broad leadership of \nRepublicans and Democrats alike and, in fact, in Senates and Houses of \nRepresentatives and White Houses of every conceivable partisan \ncombination.\n  We have essentially taken power away from the American people in two \nsteps--first, by moving power from the State and local level and taking \nit to Washington, in violation of the vertical protection we call \nfederalism; and then a second time, moving it away from the people's \nelected lawmakers in Washington to unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats \nplaced within the executive branch of government but who are neither \nelected by the people nor accountable to anyone who is electable. Thus, \nthey constitute essentially a fourth branch of government within our \nsystem, one that is not sanctioned or contemplated by the Constitution \nand doesn't really fit all that well within its framework.\n  This has made the Federal Government bigger and more powerful. It has \noccurred in a way that has made people less powerful. It has made \ngovernment in general and in particular, this government, the Federal \nGovernment, less responsive to the needs of the people. It has been \nfundamentally contrary to the way our system of government operates.\n  What, one might ask, does any of this have to do with impeachment? \nWell, in my opinion, everything--or at least a lot. This distance that \nwe have created in these two steps--moving power from the people to \nWashington and within Washington, handing it to unelected lawmakers or \nunelected bureaucrats--has created an amount of anxiety among the \nAmerican people. Not all of them necessarily recognize it in the same \nway that I do or describe it with the same words, but they know \nsomething is not right. They know it when their Federal Government \nrequires them to work many months out of every year just to pay their \nFederal taxes, only to be told later that it is not enough and hasn't \nbeen enough for\n\n\na long time since we have accumulated $22 to $23 trillion in debt, and \nwhen they come to understand that the Federal Government also imposes \nsome $2 trillion in regulatory compliance costs on the American people.\n  This harms the poor and middle class. It makes everything we buy more \nexpensive. It results in diminished wages, unemployment, and \nunderemployment. On some level, the American people feel this. They \nexperience this. They understand it. It creates anxiety. It was that \nvery anxiety that caused people to want to elect a different kind of \nleader in 2016, and they did. It was this set of circumstances that \ncaused them to elect Donald J. Trump as the 45th President of the \nUnited States, and I am glad they did because he promised to change the \nway we do things here, and he has done that.\n  But as someone who has focused intently on the need to reconnect the \nAmerican people with their system of government, Donald Trump presents \nsomething of a serious threat to those who have occupied these \npositions of power, these individuals who, while hard-working, well-\nintentioned, well-educated, and highly specialized, occupy these \npositions of power within what we loosely refer to as the executive \nbranch but is in reality an unelected, unaccountable fourth branch of \ngovernment.\n  He has bucked them on many, many levels and has infuriated them as he \nhas done so, even as he is implementing the American people's wishes to \nclose that gap between the people and the government that is supposed \nto serve them.\n  He has bucked them on so many levels, declining to defer to the \nopinions of self-proclaimed government experts who claim that they know \nbetter than any of us on a number of levels.\n  He pushed back on them, for example, when it comes to the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act--or FISA, as it is sometimes described--\nwhen he insisted that FISA had been abused in efforts to undermine his \ncandidacy and infringe on the rights of the American people. When he \ntook that position, Washington bureaucrats predictably mocked him, but \nhe turned out to be right.\n  He called out the folly of engaging in endless nation-building \nexercises as part of a two-decade-long war effort that has cost this \ncountry dearly in terms of American blood and treasure. Washington \nbureaucrats mocked him again, but he turned out to be right.\n  He raised questions with how U.S. foreign aid is used and sometimes \nmisused throughout the world, sometimes to the detriment of the \nAmerican people and the very interests that such aid was created to \nalleviate. Washington bureaucrats mocked him, but he turned out to be \nright.\n  President Trump asked Ukraine to investigate a Ukrainian energy \ncompany, Burisma. He momentarily paused U.S. aid to Ukraine while \nseeking a commitment from the then newly elected Ukrainian President, \nVolodymyr Zelensky, regarding that effort. He wanted to make sure that \nhe could trust this recently elected President Zelensky before sending \nhim the aid. Within a few weeks, his concerns were satisfied, and he \nreleased the aid. Pausing briefly before doing so isn't criminal. It \ncertainly isn't impeachable. It is not even wrong.\n  Quite to the contrary, this is exactly the sort of thing the American \npeople elected President Trump to do. He would and has decided to bring \na different paradigm to Washington, one that analyzes things from how \nthe American citizenry views the American Government.\n  This has in some respects, therefore, been a trial of the Washington, \nDC, establishment itself but not necessarily in the way the House \nmanagers apparently intended. While the House managers repeatedly \ninvoked constitutional principles, including separation of powers, \ntheir arguments have tended to prove the point opposite of the one they \nintended.\n  Yes, we badly need to restore and protect both federalism and \nseparation of power, and it is my view that the deviation from one \ncontributes to the deviation from the other. But here, in order to do \nthat, we have to respect the three branches of government for what they \nare, who leads them, how they operate, and who is accountable to whom.\n  For them to view President Trump as somehow subservient to the career \ncivil servant bureaucratic class that has tended to manage agencies \nwithin the Federal Government, including the National Security Council, \nthe Department of Defense, the Office of Management and Budget, \nindividuals in the White House, and individuals within the State \nDepartment, among others, is not only mischaracterizing this problem, \nit helps identify the precise source of this problem.\n  Many of these people, including some of the witnesses we have heard \nfrom in this trial, have mistakenly taken the conclusion that because \nPresident Trump took a conclusion different from that offered by the \nso-called interagency process, that that amounted to a constitutionally \nimpeachable act. It did not. It did nothing of the sort.\n  Quite to the contrary, when you actually look at the Constitution \nitself, it makes clear that the President has the power to do what he \ndid here. The very first section of article II of the Constitution--\nthis is the part of the Constitution that outlines the President's \nauthority--makes clear that ``[t]he executive Power [of the United \nStates Government] shall be vested in the President of the United \nStates.''\n  It is important to remember that there are exactly two Federal \nofficials who were elected within the executive branch of government. \nOne is the Vice President, and the other is the President.\n  The Vice President's duties, I would add, are relatively limited. \nConstitutionally speaking, the Vice President is the President of the \nSenate and thus performs a quasi-legislative role, but the Vice \nPresident's executive branch duties are entirely bound up with those of \nthe President's. They consist of aiding and assisting the President as \nthe President may deem necessary and standing ready to step into the \nposition of the Presidency should it become necessary as a result of \ndisability, incapacitation, or death. Barring that, the entire \nexecutive branch authority is bound up within the Presidency itself. \nThe President is the executive branch of government, just as the \nJustices who sit across the street themselves amount to the capstone of \nthe judicial branch, just as 100 Senators and 435 Representatives are \nthe legislative branch.\n  The President is the executive branch. As such, it is his \nprerogative, within the confines of what the law allows and authorizes \nand otherwise provides, to decide how to execute that. It is not only \nnot incompatible with that system of government, it is entirely \nconsistent with it--indeed, authorized by it.\n  A President should be able to say: Look, we have a newly elected \nPresident in Ukraine.\n  We have longstanding allegations of corruption within Ukraine. Those \nallegations have been well-founded in Ukraine. No one disputes that \ncorruption is rampant in Ukraine.\n  A newly elected President comes in. This President or any President \nin the future decides: Hey, we are giving a lot of aid to this \ncountry--$391 million for the year in question. I want to make sure \nthat I understand how that President operates. I want to establish a \nrelationship of trust before taking a step further with that President. \nSo I am going to take my time a little bit. I am going to wait maybe a \nfew weeks in order to make sure we are on a sure footing there.\n  He did that. There is nothing wrong with that.\n  What is the response from the House managers? Well, it gets back to \nthat interagency process, as if people whom the American people don't \nknow or have reason to know because those people don't stand \naccountable to the people--they are not elected by the people; they are \nnot really accountable to anyone who is in turn elected by the people--\nthe fact that those people involved in the interagency process might \ndisagree with a foreign policy decision made by the President of the \nUnited States and the fact that this President of the United States \nmight take a different approach than his predecessor or predecessors \ndoes not make this President's decisions criminal. It certainly doesn't \nmake them impeachable. It doesn't even make them wrong.\n  In the eyes of many and I believe most Americans--they want a \nPresident to be careful about how the\n\n\nUnited States spends money. They want the United States to stop and \nreconsider from time to time the fact that we spend a lot of money \nthroughout the world on countries that are not the United States. We \nwant a President of the United States to be able to exercise a little \nbit of discretion in pushing pause before that President knows whether \nhe can trust a newly elected government in the country in question.\n  So to suggest here that our commitment to the Constitution; to \nsuggest here, as the House managers have, that our respect for the \nseparation of powers within the constitutional framework somehow \ndemands that we remove the duly elected President of the United States \nis simply wrong. It is elevating to a status completely foreign to our \nconstitutional structure an entity that the Constitution does not name. \nIt elevates a policy dispute to a question of high crimes and \nmisdemeanors. Those two are not the same thing.\n  At the end of the day, this government does, in fact, stand \naccountable to the people. This government is of, by, and for the \npeople. We cannot remove the 45th President of the United States for \ndoing something that the law and the Constitution allow him to do \nwithout doing undue violence to that system of government to which \nevery single one of us has sworn an oath.\n  We have sworn to uphold and protect and defend that system of \ngovernment. That means standing up for the American people and those \nthey have elected to do a job recognized by the Constitution.\n  I will be voting to defend this President's actions. I will be voting \nagainst undoing the vote taken by the American people some 3\\1/2\\ years \nago. I will be voting for the principle of freedom and for the very \nprinciples that our Constitution was designed to protect.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to reject these deeply factually and \nlegally flawed Articles of Impeachment and to vote not guilty.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.", "turn": 28, "speaker_bioguide": "L000577", "itemno": 40}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "The PRESIDING OFFICER", "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to officially declare that I \nwill vote against both Articles of Impeachment brought against \nPresident Trump by the very partisan and, quite frankly, ridiculous \nHouse of Representatives. I know my position is hardly a surprise, but \nit is almost as unsurprising as the House impeaching the President, to \nbegin with.\n  Since the moment he was sworn into office, Democrats have schemed to \nremove Donald Trump from office. It is not my opinion. I take them at \ntheir word. Their fixation on his removal was a conclusion in search of \na justification, which they manufactured from a phone conversation \nbetween world leaders leaked--leaked--by one of the many career \nbureaucrats who seem to have forgotten that they work for the elected \nleaders in this country, not the other way around.\n  So the two Articles of Impeachment before this body today, in my \nview, are without merit. They are an affront, in fact, to this \ninstitution and to our Constitution, representing the very same \npartisan derangement that worried our Founding Fathers so much that \nthey made the threshold for impeachment this high.\n  The Senate exists exactly for moments like this. I didn't arrive at \nmy conclusion to support acquittal hastily or flippantly, and I don't \nbelieve any of my colleagues did either, including those who come to a \ndifferent conclusion from mine. Despite being sent such flawed Articles \nby the House, the Senate did in fact dutifully and solemnly follow its \nconstitutional obligation. During the last days of the trial, we heard \nsworn testimony from 13 witnesses, read 17 depositions, asked 180 \nquestions, viewed 193 video clips, and poured over 28,000 pages of \ndocuments.\n  But even more than the House managers' shallow arguments and lack of \nevidence against and due process for our President and the obvious \nderangement at the very root of every investigation, beginning with the \ncorrupt FBI Crossfire Hurricane counterintelligence investigation \nduring the 2016 election cycle, the Articles of Impeachment we will \nvote on in a few hours should have ended at their beginning.\n  Can we agree that if a Speaker of the House unilaterally declares an \nimpeachment inquiry, it represents the opinion of one Member of \nCongress, not the official authorization of the entire Congress? Can we \nagree that a vote to begin an impeachment inquiry that has only \npartisan support and bipartisan opposition is not what the Founders had \nin mind and in fact is what they firmly rejected and cautioned about? \nCan we agree that impeachment articles passed by a majority of one \nparty and opposed by Members of both parties on their face fail, if not \nthe letter of the law, certainly, the spirit of the Constitution?\n  Yet, even under the cloud of purely partisan politics of the House of \nRepresentatives, the Senate conducted a complete, comprehensive trial, \nresulting, in my view, in a crystal clear conclusion: The Democratic-\nled House of Representatives failed to meet the most basic standards of \nproof and has dramatically lowered the bar for impeachment to \nunacceptable levels. It is deeply concerning, and I believe we must \ncommit to never, ever letting it happen again to the President of any \npolitical party.\n  That can start today. In just a few hours, the Senate will have the \nopportunity to cast a vote to end this whole ordeal, and, in doing so, \ncan make a statement that the threshold for undoing the will of the \nAmerican people in the most recent election and undoing the will of a \nmajor political party in the upcoming election should be higher than \none party's petty obsession.\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle join me in voting \nagainst these charges. But whether he is acquitted or convicted and \nremoved, it is my prayer, as we were admonished many times throughout \nthe last few weeks by our Chaplain Black, that God's will is the one \nthat will be done.\n  Then we can move on to the unifying issues the American people want \nus to tackle--issues like infrastructure, education, energy security \nand dominance, national security, and the rising cost of healthcare, \namong many others. These are issues the American people care about. \nThese are issues that North Dakotans care about. These are issues that \nthe people have sent us here to deal with. Let's do it together.

Those \nprosecuting the President failed on a legal and constitutional basis to \nproduce the evidence required to undertake the very serious act of \nremoving a duly elected President from this office.\n  This trial exposed that pure political partisanship fueled a reckless \ninvestigation and the subsequent impeachment of the President on weak, \nvague, and noncriminal accusations.

Mr. President, fellow Senators, I come today to talk about \nthe business at hand. Obviously, it is the vote that we are going to \ntake at 4 o'clock this afternoon.\n  We were subjected to days and days of trial here--many witnesses, \nwitness statements, and all that sort of thing--and it is incumbent \nupon us now as jurors to reach a conclusion, and I have done so.\n  I come at this with a little bit of a different view, probably, than \nothers. I have tried more cases, probably, than anyone on the floor, \nboth as a prosecutor and in private practice. So I watched carefully as \nthe case was presented to us and how the case had been put together by \nthe managers from the House. What I learned in the many years of trial \nexperience that I had is that the only way, really, to try a case and \nto reach where you want to get is to do it in good faith and to do it \nhonestly.\n  I had real trouble right at the beginning when I saw that the lead \nmanager read a transcript purporting to be a transcript of the \nPresident's phone call that has been at issue here, and it was \nfalsified. It was falsified knowingly, willfully, and intentionally. \nSo, as a result of that, when they walked through the door and wanted \nto present their case, there was a strike there already, and I put it \nin that perspective.\n  How the case unfolded after that was stunning because I have never \nseen a case succeed the way they put the case together. They put the \ncase together by taking every fact that they wanted to make fly and put \nit only in the best light without showing the other side but more \nimportantly--more importantly--intentionally excluding evidence. Of \ncourse, this whole thing centered on witness statements that the \nPresident had somehow threatened or pressured the President of Ukraine \nto do what he was going to do. That simply wasn't the case. The \ntranscript didn't say that.\n  Now, admittedly, they had a witness who was going around saying that, \nand they called every person he told to tell us that that was the \nsituation. The problem is, it was hearsay. There is a good reason why \nthey don't allow hearsay in a court of law, and that is, it simply \nwasn't true.\n  When the person who was spreading that rumor actually talked to the \nPresident about it, the President got angry and said: That is not true. \nI would never do that.\n  They never told us that. Once the tape was shown, the House managers \nspent days putting together that proposition for us. The President's \ncounsel dismantled that in about an hour and did so really quickly. \nAnd, as a result of that, simply from a factual basis, it is my opinion \nthat the prosecution in this case did not meet its burden.\n  Now, much has been said about witnesses and how they did this and \nwhat have you, but the Constitution is crystal clear. It gives the \nHouse absolute, total, 100-percent control of impeachment; that is, the \ninvestigation and the vote on it. It gives us the same thing but on the \ntrial basis.\n  The thing I think was surprising is that they came over here and \ntried to tell us how to do their job. I suspect they, in the House, \nwould feel the exact same way about it if we went over there and told \nthem how they should impeach. They came over here and told us how we \nshould do witnesses and all that sort of thing. They had every \nopportunity to prepare the case. It was totally in their hands. They \nhad as much time as they wanted, and they simply didn't do it. So in \nthat respect, I also found that they came short.\n  But the bottom line for me, too, is that there is a second reason I \nwould vote to acquit, and that is the stunning attack that this was on \nthe U.S. Constitution. This is really the first time in history when a \npurely political attack was instigated by reaching to the U.S. \nConstitution and using what is really a sacred item in that \nConstitution, a process that the Founding Fathers gave us for good \nreason, and that is impeachment.\n  It was not intended to be used as a political bludgeon. It simply \nwasn't. We had in front of us the Federalist Papers, and we had the \ndebates of the Constitutional Convention. Really, the one silver lining \nthat came out of this was it underscored again for us the genius of the \nFounding Fathers giving us three branches of government--not just three \nbranches of government but three branches of government that had \ndistinct lanes in which they operated and, most importantly, indicating \nthat they were separate but equal.\n  They wanted not a parliamentary system like they had looked at from \nBritain with a head of state that was a Prime Minister who could be \nremoved and changed, as happens all around the world today. They gave \nus a unique system with three branches of government.\n  So the Founding Fathers were very clear. They debated the question of \nwhat should it take to get rid of the head of state, and they concluded \nthat the second branch of government couldn't be a strong branch of \ngovernment if, indeed, the President could be removed as a Prime \nMinister could be removed, simply by Congress getting unhappy with his \npolicies or disagreeing with him. So, as a result of that, they did \ngive us impeachment, and it is a unique process. They were very clear \nthat it was supposed to be used only in very extreme circumstances and \nnot just simply because of a political disagreement or a policy \ndisagreement. And that is exactly what happened here.\n  The Federalist Papers and the Constitutional Convention debates are \nvery, very clear that it is not a broad swath of reasons to impeach the \nPresident that is given to the first branch of government but, indeed, \na very, very narrow swath. It was interesting that, from the beginning, \nthey picked the two words of ``treason'' and ``bribery,'' and to that \nthey then had a long debate about what it would be in addition to that. \nThey had such words as ``malfeasance,'' ``misfeasance,'' \n``corruption,'' and all those kinds of things that could be very broad. \nThey rejected all those and said, no, specifically, it had to be ``high \nCrimes and Misdemeanors.''\n  So what they did was they narrowed the lane considerably and made it \ndifficult to remove the head of the second branch of government. And \nthen, on top of that, for frosting on the cake, they said it has got to \nbe two-thirds. Now, what did that simply mean? They knew--they knew--\nthat human beings being the way they are, that human beings who were \ninvolved in the political process and political parties would reach to \nget rid of a political enemy using everything they could. So they \nwanted to see that that didn't happen with impeachment. So, as a result \nof that, they gave us the two-thirds requirement, and that meant that \nno President was going to be impeached without a bipartisan movement.\n  This movement has been entirely partisan. No Republican voted to \nimpeach him in the House of Representatives. This afternoon at 4 we are \ngoing to have a vote, and it is going to be along party lines and, \nagain, it is going to be political.\n  So what do we have here? At the end of the day, we have a political \nexercise, and that political exercise is going to fail.

Madam President, over the past 3 weeks, we have heard from \nthe House managers and the President's counsel regarding the facts of \nthe case against President Donald Trump.\n  Much like trials in Lorain and Lima and Lordstown, OH, or in \nMarietta, in Massillon, and in Marion, OH, we have seen the \nprosecution--in this case, the House managers--and the defense--in this \ncase, the President's lawyers--present their cases. All 100 of us--\nevery one of us--are the jury. We took an oath to be impartial jurors. \nWe all took an oath to be impartial jurors just like juries in Ohio and \nacross America. But to some of my colleagues, that just appeared to be \na joke.\n  The great journalist Bill Moyers summed up the past 3 weeks: ``What \nwe've just seen is the dictator of the Senate manipulating the \nimpeachment process to save the demagogue in the White House whose \npolitical party has become the gravedigger of democracy.''\n  Let me say that again. ``What we have just seen is the dictator of \nthe\n\n\nSenate manipulating the impeachment process to save the demagogue in \nthe White House whose political party has become the gravedigger of \ndemocracy.''\n  Even before this trial began, Leader McConnell admitted out loud that \nhe was coordinating the trial process with the White House. The leader \nof the Senate was coordinating with the White House on impeachment. I \nchallenge him to show me one trial in my State of Ohio or his State of \nKentucky where the jury coordinated with the defense lawyers. In a fair \ntrial, the defense and prosecution would have been able to introduce \nevidence, to call witnesses, and to listen to testimony.\n  Every other impeachment proceeding in the Senate for 250 years had \nwitnesses. Some of them had dozens. We had zero. Leader McConnell \nrushed this trial through. He turned off cameras in this body so that \nthe American public couldn't see the whole process. He restricted \nreporter access. We know reporters roam the halls to talk to Members of \nthe House and Senate. He restricted access there. He twisted arms to \nmake sure every Republican voted with him to block witnesses. He didn't \nget a couple of them, but he had enough to protect himself.\n  The public already sees through it. This is a sham trial. I said from \nthe beginning that I would keep an open mind. If there are witnesses \nwho would exonerate the President, the American people need to hear \nfrom them.\n  Over the course of this trial we heard mounting, overwhelming \nevidence that President Trump did something that not even Richard Nixon \never did: He extorted a foreign leader. He fired a career foreign \nservice officer for rooting out corruption. He put his own Presidential \ncampaign above our collective national security.\n  The President said this is just hearsay, but he and the Republican \nleader, together with 51 of 53 Republican Senators, blocked every \nsingle potential witness we wanted to call. The President says it was \nhearsay. We knew there were witnesses who were in the room with \nPresident Trump. We didn't get to hear from them. We didn't hear from \nAmbassador Bolton. We didn't hear from interim Chief of Staff Mulvaney. \nWe didn't hear from Secretary Pompeo. The Republican leader denied the \nAmerican people the chance to hear all of them testify under oath.\n  We have seen more information come to light each day, which builds on \nthe pattern of facts laid out in great detail by the House managers. We \nhave now heard tape recordings of the President of the United States \ntelling associates to ``get rid of'' U.S. Ambassador Yovanovitch, a \npublic servant who devoted her life to fighting corruption and \npromoting American ideals and foreign policy throughout her long, \ndistinguished career at the State Department. With her removed from the \npost, it appears the President thought he would be able to compel our \nally Ukraine to investigate President Trump's political opponent.\n  Reporters have now revealed that Ambassador Bolton--again, a \nfirsthand witness--outlined that the President did exactly what the \nImpeachment Articles allege: He withheld security assistance to an ally \nat war with Russia in exchange for a political favor.\n  The Justice Department admits there are 24 emails showing the \nPresident's thinking on Ukraine assistance. But you know what? Senator \nMcConnell, down the hall, will not allow us to see any of these 24 \nemails.\n  Make no mistake, the full truth is going to come out. The Presiding \nOfficer, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, they are all \ngoing to be embarrassed because they covered this up. It wasn't just \nthe President and the Vice President and Secretary Pompeo and Chief of \nStaff Mulvaney; it was 51 Republican U.S. Senators, including the \nPresiding Officer, who is a new Member of this body, who covered up \nthis evidence.\n  It will come out this week. It will come out this month, this year, \nthe year after that, for decades to come. And when the full truth comes \nout, we will be judged by our children and grandchildren.\n  Without additional witnesses, we must judge based on the facts \npresented. The House managers made a clear, compelling case. In the \nmiddle of a war with Russia, the President froze $400 million in \nsecurity assistance to Ukraine. He wanted an investigation into his \n2020 political opponent. He refused a critical meeting with President \nZelensky in the Oval Office.\n  These actions don't promote our national security or the rule of law; \nthey promote Donald Trump personally and his campaign.\n  We know the President extorted President Zelensky. He asked the \nleader of a foreign government to help him. That is the definition of \nan abuse of power. That is why we have no choice--no choice--but to \nconvict this President of abusing his office. All of us know this. To \nacquit would set a clear, dangerous precedent: If you abuse your \noffice, it is OK. Congress will look the other way.\n  This trial and these votes we are about to cast are about way more \nthan just President Trump. They are about the future of democracy. It \nwill send a message to this President--or whomever we elect in \nNovember--and to all future Presidents. It will be heard around the \nworld--our verdict--by our allies and enemies alike, especially the \nRussians. Are we going to roll out the welcome mat to our adversaries \nto interfere in our elections? Are we going to give a green light to \nthe President of the United States to base our country's foreign policy \nnot on our collective, agreed-upon national security or that of our \nallies, like Ukraine, but on the President's personal political \ncampaign?\n  These are the issues at stake. If we don't hold this President \naccountable for abuse of office, if no one in his own party, if no one \non this side of the aisle--no one--has the backbone to stand up and say \n``stop,'' there is no question it will get worse. How do I know that? I \nhave heard it from a number of my Republican colleagues when, \nprivately, they will tell me, yes, we are concerned about what the \nPresident is going to do if he is exonerated.\n  I was particularly appalled by the words of Mr. Dershowitz. He said: \n``If a President does something which he believes will help him get \nelected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo \nthat results in impeachment.''\n  Think about that for a moment. If the President thinks it is OK, he \nthinks it is going to help his election, and he thinks his election is \nin the public interest, then it is OK; the President can break any law, \ncan funnel taxpayer money toward his reelection, can turn the arm of \nthe State against his political enemies and not be held accountable. \nThat is what this claim comes down to.\n  Remember the words of Richard Nixon: ``When the President does it, \nthat means it is not illegal.'' Our country rejected that argument \nduring Watergate. We had a Republican Party with principle in those \ndays and Senators with backbone, and they told that President to resign \nbecause nobody is above the State; nobody is above the law.\n  If we have a President who can turn the Office of the Presidency and \nthe entire executive branch into his own political campaign operation, \nGod help us.\n  My colleagues think I am exaggerating. We don't have the option to \nvote in favor of some arguments made during the trial and not others. \nMr. Dershowitz's words will live forever in the historical record. If \nthey are allowed to stand beside a ``not guilty'' verdict--make no \nmistake--they will be used as precedent by future aspiring autocrats. \nIn the words of House Manager Schiff, ``that way madness lies.''\n  I know some of my colleagues agree this sets a dangerous precedent. \nSome of you have admitted to me that you are troubled by the \nPresident's behavior. You know he is reckless. You know he lies. You \nknow what he did was wrong. I have heard Republican after Republican \nafter Republican Senator tell me that privately. If you acknowledge \nthat, if you have said it to me, if you said it to your family, if you \nsaid it to your staff, if you just said it to yourself, I implore you, \nwe have no choice but to vote to convict.\n  What are my colleagues afraid of? I think about the words of Adam \nSchiff in this Chamber on Tuesday: ``If you find that the House has \nproved its case and still vote to acquit''--if you still vote to \nacquit--``your name will be tied to his with a cord of steel and for \nall of history.''\n  ``[Y]our name will be tied to his with a cord of steel and for all of \nhistory.''\n  So I ask my colleagues again: What are you afraid of?\n\n\n  One of our American fundamental values is that we have no Kings, no \nnobility, no oligarchs. No matter how rich, no matter how powerful, no \nmatter how much money you give to Mitch McConnell's super PAC, everyone \ncan and should be held accountable.\n  I hope my colleagues remember that. I hope they will choose courage \nover fear. I hope they will choose country over party. I hope they will \njoin me in holding this President accountable to the American people we \nall took an oath to serve.\n  We know this: Americans are watching. They will not forget.\n  I will close with quoting, again, Bill Moyers, a longtime journalist: \n``What we have just seen is the dictator of the Senate manipulating the \nimpeachment process to save the demagogue in the White House whose \npolitical party has become the gravedigger of democracy.''\n  I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle know better.

Madam President, when the Framers debated whether to \ninclude the power of impeachment in the Constitution, they envisioned a \nmoment very much like the one we face now. They were fearful of a \ncorrupt President who would abuse the Presidency for his or her \npersonal gain, particularly one who would allow any foreign country to \ninterfere in the affairs of our United States. With this fear in mind, \nthe Framers directed the Senate to determine whether to ultimately \nremove that President from office.\n\n  In normal times, the Senate--conscious of its awesome \nresponsibility--would meet this moment with the appropriate sobriety \nand responsibility to conduct a full and fair trial. That includes \ncalling appropriate witnesses and subpoenaing relevant documents, none \nof which happened here.\n  In normal times, the Senate would have weighed the evidence presented \nby both sides and rendered impartial justice. And in normal times, \nhaving been presented with overwhelming evidence of impeachable acts, \nthe Senate would have embraced its constitutional responsibility to \nconvict the President and remove him or her from office.\n  But as we have learned too often over the past 3 years, these are not \nnormal times. Instead of fulfilling its duty later today, the U.S. \nSenate will fail its test at a crucial moment of our country by voting \nto acquit Donald J. Trump of abuse of power and obstruction of \nCongress.\n  The Senate cannot blame its constitutional failure on the House \nmanagers. They proved their case with overwhelming and compelling \nevidence. Manager Jerry Nadler laid out a meticulous case demonstrating \nhow and why the President's actions rose to the constitutional standard \nfor impeachment and removal.\n  Manager Hakeem Jeffries explained how Donald Trump ``directly \npressured the Ukrainian leader to commence phony political \ninvestigations as a part of his effort to cheat and solicit foreign \ninterference in the 2020 election.''\n  Manager Val Demings walked us through the evidence of how Donald \nTrump used $391 million of taxpayer money to pressure Ukraine to \nannounce politically motivated investigations. She concluded: ``This is \nenough to prove extortion in court.''\n  Manager Sylvia Garcia showed us how Donald Trump's demand for \ninvestigations was purely for his personal, political benefit. She \ndebunked the conspiracy theories the President's counsel raised against \nformer Vice President Joe Biden--Donald Trump's political rival and the \ntrue target of his corrupt scheme.\n  Manager Jason Crow described vividly the human costs of withholding \naid from Ukrainian troops fighting a hot war against Russia.\n  Manager Adam Schiff tied together the evidence of Donald Trump's \nabuse of power--the most serious of impeachable offenses and one that \nincludes extortion and bribery.\n  And manager Zoe Lofgren used her extensive experience to provide \nperspective on Donald Trump's unprecedented, unilateral, and complete \nobstruction of Congress to cover up his corrupt scheme. She is the only \nMember of Congress to be involved in three Presidential impeachments.\n  The President's lawyers could not refute the House's case. Instead, \nthey ultimately resorted to the argument that, even accepting the facts \nas presented by the House managers, Donald Trump's conduct is not \nimpeachable. It is what I have called the ``He did it; so what?'' \nargument.\n  Many of my Republican colleagues are using the ``So what?'' argument \nto justify their votes to let the President off the hook. Yet the \nsenior Senator from Tennessee said: ``I think he shouldn't have done \nit. I think it was wrong.'' He said it was ``inappropriate'' and \n``improper, crossing a line.'' But he refused to hold the President \naccountable, arguing that the voters should decide.\n  The junior Senator from Iowa said: ``The President has a lot of \nlatitude to do what he wants to do'' but he ``did it maybe in the wrong \nmanner.''\n  She also said that ``whether you like what the President did or \nnot,'' the charges didn't rise to the level of an impeachable offense.\n  The junior Senator from Ohio called the President's actions ``wrong \nand inappropriate'' but said they did not ``rise to the level of \nremoving a duly-elected president from office and taking him off the \nballot in the middle of an election.''\n  And the senior Senator from Florida went so far as to say: ``Just \nbecause actions meet a standard of impeachment does not mean it is in \nthe best interest of the country to remove a president from office.''\n  By refusing to hold this President accountable, my Republican \ncolleagues are reinforcing the President's misguided belief that he can \ndo whatever he wants under article II of the U.S. Constitution.\n  Donald Trump was already a danger to this country. We have seen it in \nhis policy decisions--from taking away healthcare from millions of \nAmericans to threatening painful cuts to Social Security and Medicare, \nto engaging in an all-out assault on immigrants in this country.\n  But today, we are called on to confront a completely different type \nof danger--one that goes well beyond the significant policy differences \nI have with this President.\n  If we let Donald Trump get away with extorting the President of \nanother country for his own personal, political benefit, the Senate \nwill be complicit--complicit--in his next corrupt scheme.\n  Which country will he bully or invite to interfere in our elections \nnext? Which pot of taxpayer money will he use as a bribe to further his \npolitical schemes?\n  Later today, I will vote to convict and remove President Donald Trump \nfor abusing his power and obstructing Congress. I am under no illusion \nthat my Republican colleagues will do the same. They have argued it is \nup to the American people to decide, as though impeachment were not a \ntotally separate, constitutional remedy for a lawless President.\n  As I considered my vote, I listened closely to Manager Schiff's \nclosing statement about why the Senate needs to convict this President. \nHe said:\n\n       I do not ask you to convict him because truth or right or \n     decency matters nothing to him--\n\n  He is referring to the President--\n\n     but because we have proven our case, and it matters to you. \n     Truth matters to you. Right matters to you. You are decent. \n     He is not who you are.\n\n  It is time for the Senate to uphold its constitutional responsibility \nby convicting this President and holding him accountable.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 40, "speaker_bioguide": "H001042", "itemno": 52}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "The PRESIDING OFFICER", "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, when I was in the second grade--which I \ndid twice because I was dyslexic, so I don't know which year of the \nsecond grade it was, but one of those 2 years--we were asked to line up \nin order of whose family had been here the longest period of time and \nwhose family had been here the shortest period of time.\n  I turned out to be the answer to both of those questions. My father's \nfamily went all the way back to the Mayflower, and my mom's family were \nPolish Jews who survived the Holocaust. They didn't leave Warsaw \nbecause my grandfather had a large family he didn't want to leave \nbehind. And in the event--everybody was killed in the war, except my \nmom, her parents, and an aunt. They lived in Warsaw for 2 years after \nthe war. Then they went to Stockholm for a year. They went to\n\n\nMexico City for a year, of all places. And then they came to the United \nStates--the one place in the world they could rebuild their shattered \nlives, and they did rebuild their shattered lives. My mom was the only \nperson in the family who could speak any English. She registered \nherself in the New York City public schools. She graduated from Hunter \nCollege High School. She went on to graduate from Wellesley College in \nMassachusetts in one generation. My grandparents rebuilt the business \nthey had lost during the war.\n  I knew from them how important this symbol of America was to people \nstruggling all over the world. They had been through some of the worst \nevents in human history, and their joy of being Americans was \ncompletely unadulterated. I have met many immigrants across this \ncountry, and I still haven't met anybody with a stronger accent than my \ngrandparents had, and I have never met anybody who were greater \npatriots than they were. They understood how important the idea of \nAmerica was, not because we were perfect--exactly the opposite of \nthat--because we were imperfect. But we lived in a free society that \nwas able to cure its imperfections with the hard work of our citizens \nto make this country more democratic, more free, and more fair--a \ncountry committed to the rule of law. Nobody was above the rule of law, \nand nobody was treated unfairly by the law, even if you were an \nimmigrant to this country.\n  From my dad's example, I learned something really different. It might \ninterest some people around here to know he was a staffer in the Senate \nfor many years. I actually grew up coming here on Saturday mornings, \nthrowing paper airplanes around the hallways of the Dirksen Building \nand Russell Building.\n  He worked here at a very different time in the Senate. He worked here \nat a time when Republicans and Democrats worked together to uphold the \nrule of law, to pass important legislation that was needed by the \nAmerican people to move our country forward, a time when Democrats and \nRepublicans went back home and said: I didn't get everything I wanted, \nto be sure, but the 65 percent I did get is worth the bill we have, and \nhere is why the other side needed 35 percent.\n  Those days are completely gone in the U.S. Senate, and I grieve for \nthem. My dad passed away about a year ago. I know how disappointed he \nwould be about where we are, but there isn't anybody who can fix it, \nexcept the 100 people who are here and, I suppose, the American people \nfor whom we ostensibly work.\n  In the last 10 years that I have been here, I have watched \npoliticians come to this floor and destroy the solemn responsibility we \nhave--the constitutional responsibility we have--to advise and consent \non judicial appointments, to turn that constitutional responsibility \ninto nothing more than a vicious partisan exercise. That hasn't been \ndone by the American people. That wasn't done by any other generation \nof politicians who were in this place. It has been done by this \ngeneration of politicians led by the Senator from Kentucky, the \nmajority leader of the Senate.\n  We have become a body that does nothing. We are an employment agency. \nThat is what we are. Seventy-five percent of the votes we took last \nyear were on appointments. We voted on 26 amendments last year--26--26. \nIn the world's greatest deliberative body, we passed eight amendments \nin a year. Pathetic. We didn't consider any of the major issues the \nAmerican people are confronting in their lives, not a single one--10 \nyears of townhalls with people saying to me: Michael, we are killing \nourselves, and we can't afford housing, healthcare, higher education, \nearly childhood education. We cannot save. We can't live a middle-class \nlife. We think our kids are going to live a more diminished life than \nwe do.\n  What does the U.S. Senate do? Cut taxes for rich people. We don't \nhave time to do anything else around here. And now, when we are the \nonly body on planet Earth charged with the responsibility of dealing \nwith the guilt or innocence of this President, we can't even bring \nourselves to have witnesses and evidence as part of a fair trial, even \nwhen there are literally witnesses with direct knowledge of what the \nPresident did practically banging on the door of the Senate saying: Let \nme testify.\n  We are too lazy for that. The reality is, we are too broken for that. \nWe are too broken for that. And we have failed in our duty to the \nAmerican people.\n  Hamilton said in Federalist 65 that in an impeachment trial we were \nthe inquisitors for the people. The Senate--we would be the inquisitors \nfor the people. How can you be the inquisitors for the people when you \ndon't even dignify the process with evidence and with witnesses?\n  I often have school kids come visit me here in the Senate, which I \nreally enjoy because I used to be the superintendent of the Denver \nPublic Schools. When they come visit me, they very often have been on \nthe Mall. They have seen the Lincoln Memorial. They have seen the \nWashington Monument. They have been seen the Supreme Court, this \nCapitol. And there is a tendency among them to believe that this was \njust all here, that it was all just here. And of course, 230 years ago, \nI tell them, none of it was here. None of it was here. It was in the \nideas of the Founders, the people whom we call the Founders, who did \ntwo incredible things in their lifetime, in their generation, that had \nnever been done before in human history. They wrote a Constitution that \nwould be ratified by the people who lived under it. It never happened \nbefore. They would never have imagined that we would have lasted 230 \nyears--at least until the age of Donald Trump.\n\n  They led an armed insurrection against a colonial power. We call that \nthe Revolutionary War. That succeeded too.\n  They did something terrible in their generation that will last for \nthe rest of our days and that is they perpetuated human slavery. The \nbuilding we are standing in today was built by enslaved human beings \nbecause of the decisions that they made.\n  But I tell the kids who come and visit me that there is a reason why \nthere are not enslaved human beings in this country anymore and that is \nbecause of people like Frederick Douglass. He was born a slave in the \nUnited States of America, escaped his slavery in Maryland, risked his \nlife and limb to get to Massachusetts, and he found the abolitionist \nmovement there. And the abolitionist movement has been arguing for \ngenerations that the Constitution was a pro-slavery document. Frederick \nDouglass, who is completely self-taught, said to them: You have this \nexactly wrong, exactly backward, 180 degrees from the truth. The \nConstitution is an anti-slavery document, Frederick Douglass said, not \na pro-slavery document.\n  But we are not living up to the words of the Constitution. It is the \nsame thing Dr. King said the night before he was killed in Memphis when \nhe went down there for the striking garbage workers and he said: I am \nhere to make America keep the promise you wrote down on the page.\n  In my mind, Frederick Douglass and Dr. King are Founders, just as \nmuch as the people who wrote the Constitution of the United States. How \ncould they not be? How could they not be?\n  The women who fought to give my kids, my three daughters, the right \nto vote, who fought for 50 years to get the right to vote--mostly women \nin this country--are Founders, just like the people who wrote the \nConstitution, as well.\n  Over the years that I have been here, I have seen this institution \ncrumble into rubble. This institution has become incapable of \naddressing the most existential questions of our time that the next \ngeneration cannot address. They can't fix their own school. They can't \nfix our immigration system. They can't fix climate change, although \nthey are getting less and less patient with us on that issue.\n  But what I have come to conclude is that the responsibility of all of \nus--not just Senators but all of us as citizens in a democratic \nrepublic--230 years after the founding of this Republic, is the \nresponsibility of a Founder. It is that elevated sense of what a \ncitizen is required to do in a republic to sustain that republic, and I \nthink that is the right way to think about it. It gives you a sense of \nwhat is really at stake beyond the headlines on the cable television at \nnight and, certainly, in the social media feeds that divide us minute \nto minute in our political life today.\n\n\n  The Senate has clearly failed that standard. We have clearly failed \nthat standard. The idea that we would turn our backs and close our eyes \nto evidence pounding on the outside of the doors of this Capitol is \npitiful. It is disgraceful, and it will be a stain on this body for all \ntime. More than 50 percent of the people in this place have said that \nwhat the President did was wrong. It clearly was wrong. It clearly was \nunconstitutional. It clearly was impeachable. What President would run \nfor office saying to the American people: I am going to try to extort a \nforeign power for my own electoral interest to interfere in our \nelections? It is exactly the kind of conduct that the impeachment \nclause was written for. It is a textbook case of why the impeachment \nclause exists.\n  But even if you don't agree with me that he should have been \nconvicted or that he should be convicted, I don't know how anybody in \nthis body goes home and faces their constituents and says that we \nwouldn't even look at the evidence.\n  So I say to the American people: Our democracy is very much at risk. \nI am not one of those people who believes that Donald Trump is the \nsource of all our problems. I think he has made matters much worse, to \nbe sure, but he is a symptom of our problem. He is a symptom of our \nfailure to tend to the democracy--to our responsibility--as Founders. \nAnd if we don't begin to take that responsibility as seriously as our \nparents and grandparents did--people who faced much bigger challenges \nthan we ever did--nobody is asking us, thank God, to end human slavery. \nNobody is asking us to fight for 50 years for the self-evident \nproposition that women should have the right to vote. We are not \nmarching in Selma, being beaten for the self-evident prospect that all \npeople are created equal. Nobody is asking us to climb the Cliffs of \nNormandy to fight for freedom in a World War.\n  But we are being asked to save the democracy and we are going to fail \nthat test today in the Senate. And my prayer for our country is that \nthe American people will not fail that test. I am optimistic that we \nwill not. We have never failed it before, and I don't think we will \nfail it in our time.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 42, "speaker_bioguide": "B001267", "itemno": 54}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "The PRESIDING OFFICER", "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

President Trump has obstructed Congress, and this Senate will \nlet him.\n  Last month, President Trump's former National Security Advisor, John \nBolton, provided an unpublished manuscript to the White House. The \nrecent media reports about what Ambassador Bolton could have testified \nto, had he not been blocked as a witness, go to the heart of this \nimpeachment trial--abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.\n  As reported, in early May 2019, there was an Oval Office meeting that \nincluded President Trump, Mick Mulvaney, Pat Cipollone, Rudy Giuliani, \nand John Bolton. According to Mr. Bolton, the President directed him to \nhelp with his pressure campaign to solicit assistance from Ukraine to \npursue investigations that would not only benefit President Trump \npolitically but would act to exonerate Russia from their interference \nin our 2016 elections.\n  Several weeks later, the U.S. Department of Defense certified the \nrelease of military aid to Ukraine, concluding that they had taken \nsubstantial actions to decrease corruption. This was part of the \nsecurity assistance we approved in Congress with bipartisan support to \nhelp Ukraine fight Russian aggression. However, President Trump blocked \nit and covered it up from Congress.\n  On July 25, 2019, as President Trump was withholding the support for \nUkraine, he had a telephone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky. \nBased on a White House call summary memo that was released 2 months \nlater, we all know the President put his own political interest ahead \nof our national security and the integrity of our elections.\n  Based on the clear and convincing evidence presented in this trial, \nwe know President Trump used American taxpayer dollars in security \nassistance in order to get Ukraine to interfere in our elections to \nhelp him politically. We know the President solicited assistance from \nUkraine to pursue an investigation of phony conspiracy theories about \nour 2016 U.S. elections that are a part of a Russian disinformation \ncampaign. We know the President solicited assistance from Ukraine to \ndiscredit the conclusion by American law enforcement, the U.S. \nintelligence community, and confirmed by a bipartisan Senate report \nthat Russia interfered with our 2016 elections. We also know President \nTrump solicited foreign interference in the upcoming election by \npressuring Ukraine to publicly announce investigations to help him \npolitically.\n  I ask my friends to consider the fact that the Ukrainian President \nwas pressured and prepared to go on an American cable television \nnetwork to announce these political investigations.\n  To those who are making the argument to acquit the President because \nto convict would create further division in our country, I ask you to \nacknowledge the fact that President Trump's corrupt scheme has given \nRussia another opening to attack our democracy, interfere in our \nelections, and further divide our already divided country. We know this \nto be true, but the Senate is choosing to ignore the truth.\n  As reported just weeks after the Zelensky call, President Trump told \nAmbassador Bolton in August that he wanted to continue freezing $391 \nmillion in security assistance to Ukraine until it helped with the \npolitical investigations. Had Ambassador Bolton testified to these \nfacts in this trial, it would have directly contradicted what the \nPresident told Senator Johnson in a phone call on August 31, 2019, in \nwhich, according to Senator Johnson, the President said:\n\n       I would never do that. Who told you that?\n\n  John Bolton not only has direct evidence that implicates President \nTrump in a corrupt abuse of power, but he has direct evidence that \nPresident Trump lied to one of our colleagues in an attempt to cover it \nup. It may not matter to this Senate, but I can tell you that it \nmatters to the people of the State of Wisconsin that this President did \nnot tell their Senator the truth.\n  Based on the facts presented to us, I refuse to join this President's \ncoverup, and I refuse to conclude that the President's abuse of power \ndoesn't matter, that it is OK, and that we should just get over it.\n  I recognize the courageous public servants who did what this Senate \nhas failed to do--to put our country first. In the House impeachment \ninquiry, brave government servants came forward and told the truth. \nThey put their jobs on the line. Instead of inspiring us to do our \nduty--to do our jobs--they\n\n\nhave faced character assassination from this President, the White \nHouse, and some of my colleagues here in the Senate. It is a disgrace \nto this institution that they have been treated as anything less than \nthe patriots they are.\n  As Army LTC Alexander Vindman said, ``This is America. Here, right \nmatters.''\n  My judgment is inspired by these words, and I am guided to my \ncommitment to put country before party and our Constitution first.\n  My vote on the President's abuse of power and obstruction of Congress \nis a vote to uphold my oath of office and to support and defend the \nConstitution. My vote is a vote to uphold the rule of law and our \nuniquely American principle that no one--not even the President--is \nabove the law. I only have 1 of 100 votes in the U.S. Senate, and I am \nafraid that the majority is putting this President above the law by not \nconvicting him of these impeachable offenses.\n  Let's be clear. This is not an exoneration of President Trump. It is \na failure to show moral courage and hold this President accountable.\n  Now every American will have the power to make his or her own \njudgment. Every American gets to decide what is in our public interest. \nWe the people get to choose what is in our national interest. I trust \nthe American people. I know they will be guided by our common good and \nthe truth. The people we work for know what the truth is, and they \nknow, in America, it matters.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 44, "speaker_bioguide": "B001230", "itemno": 56}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "The PRESIDING OFFICER", "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, it is important to remind ourselves, at \nmoments like this, how unnatural and uncommon democracy really is.\n  Just think of all of the important forums in your life. Think about \nyour workplace, your family, your favorite sports team. None of them \nmakes decisions by democratic vote. The CEO decides how much money you \nare going to make. It is not by the vote of your fellow employees. You \nlove your kids, but they don't get an equal say in household matters as \nmom and dad do. The plays the Chiefs called on their game-winning \ndrives were not decided by a team vote.\n  No, most everything in our lives that matters, other than the \ngovernment under which we live, is not run by democratic vote, and, of \ncourse, a tiny percentage of humans--well under 1 percent--have lived \nin a democratic society over the last thousand years of human history.\n  Democracy is unnatural. It is rare. It is delicate. It is fragile, \nand untended to, neglected, or taken for granted, it will disappear \nlike ashes that scatter into the cold night.\n  This body--the U.S. Senate--was conceived by our Founders to be the \nultimate guardians of this brittle experiment in governance. We, the \n100 of us, were given the responsibility to keep it safe from those who \nmay deign to harm it, and when the Senate lives up to this charge, it \nis an awesome, inspirational sight to behold.\n  I was born 3 weeks after Alexander Butterfield revealed the existence \nof a taping system in the White House that likely held evidence of \nPresident Nixon's crimes, and I was born 1 week after the Senate \nWatergate Committee, in a bipartisan vote, ordered Nixon to turn over \nseveral key tapes.\n  Now, my parents were Republicans. My mom is still a Republican. Over \nthe years, they have voted for a lot of Democrats and Republicans. They \nraised me, in the shadow of Watergate, to understand that what mattered \nin politics wasn't really someone's party. It was whether you were \nhonest and decent and if you were pursuing office for the right \nreasons.\n  In the year I was born, this Senate watched a President betray the \nNation, and this Senate--both Democrats and Republicans--stood together \nto protect the country from this betrayal. This is exactly what our \nFounders envisioned when they gave the Congress the massive \nresponsibility of the impeachment power. They said to use it sparingly, \nto use it not to settle political scores but to use it when a President \nhas strayed from the bonds of decency and propriety.\n  The Founders wanted Congress to save the country from bad men who \nwould try to use the awesome power of the executive branch to enrich \nthemselves or to win office illicitly, and I grew up under the belief \nthat, when those bad men presented themselves, this place had the \nability to put aside party and work to protect our fragile democracy \nfrom attack.\n  This attack on our Republic that we are debating today, if left \nunchecked, is potentially lethal. The one sacred covenant that an \nAmerican President makes with the governed is to use the massive power \nof the executive branch for the good of the country, not for personal \nfinancial or political benefit. The difference between a democracy and \na tin-pot dictatorship is that, here, we don't allow Presidents to use \nthe official levers of power to destroy political opponents. Yet that \nis exactly what President Trump did, and we all know it. Even the \nRepublicans who are going to vote to acquit him today admit that. If \nyou think that our endorsement through acquittal will not have an \nimpact, then, just look at Rudy Giuliani's trip to Ukraine in December, \nwhich was in the middle of the impeachment process. He went back, \nlooking for more dirt, and the President was ringing him up to get the \ndetails before Giuliani's plane even hit the gate. The corruption \nhasn't stopped. It is ongoing. If this is the new normal--the new means \nby which a President can consolidate power and try to destroy political \nopponents--then we are no longer living in America.\n  What happened here over the last 2 weeks is as much a corruption as \nTrump's scheme was. This trial was simply an extension of Trump's \ncrimes--no documents, no witnesses. It was the first-ever impeachment \ntrial in the Senate without either. John Bolton, in his practically \nbegging to come here and tell his firsthand account of the President's \ncorruption, was denied--just to make sure that voters couldn't hear his \nstory in time for them to be able to pressure their Senators prior to \nan impeachment vote.\n  This was a show trial--a gift-wrapped present for a grateful party \nleader. We became complicit in the very attacks on democracy that this \nbody is supposed to guard against. We have failed to protect the \nRepublic.\n  What is so interesting to me is that it is not like the Republicans \ndidn't see this moment coming. In fact, many of my colleagues across \nthe aisle literally predicted it. Prior to the President's election, \nhere is what the Republican Senators said about Donald Trump.\n  One said:\n\n       He is shallow. He is ill-prepared to be Commander in Chief. \n     I think he is crazy. I think he is unfit for office.\n\n  Another said:\n\n       The man is a pathological liar. He doesn't know the \n     difference between truth and lies.\n\n  Yet another Republican Senator said:\n\n       What we are dealing with is a con artist. He is a con \n     artist.\n\n  Now, you can shrug this off as election-year rhetoric, but no \nDemocrat has ever said these kinds of things about a candidate from our \nparty, and prior to Trump, no Republican had said such things about \ncandidates from their party either. The truth is the Republicans, \nbefore Trump became the head of their party, knew exactly how dangerous \nhe was and how dangerous he would be if he won. They knew he was the \narchetype of that bad man the Founders intended the Senate to protect \ndemocracy from.\n  That responsibility seems to no longer retain a position of primacy \nin this body today. The rule of law doesn't seem to come first today. \nOur commitment to upholding decency and truth and honor is not the \npriority today. In the modern Senate today, all that seems to matter is \nparty. What is different about this impeachment is not that the \nDemocrats have chosen to make it partisan. It is that the Republicans \nhave chosen to excuse their party's President's conduct in a way that \nthey would not have done and did not do 45 years ago. That is what \nmakes this moment exceptional.\n  Now, Congressman Schiff, in his closing argument, rightly challenged \nthe Democrats to think about what we would do if a President of our \nparty ever committed the same kind of offense that Donald Trump has. I \nthink it was a very wise query and one that we as Democrats should not \nbe so quick on the trigger to answer self-righteously.\n\n\n  Would we have the courage to stand up to our base, to our political \nsupporters, and vote to remove a Democratic President who had chosen to \ntrade away the safety of the Nation for political help? It would not be \neasy. No, the easy thing to do would be to just do what is happening \ntoday--to box our ears, close our eyes, and just hope the corruption \ngoes away.\n  So I have thought a lot about this question over these past 2 days, \nand I have come to the conclusion that, at least for me, I would hold \nthe Democrats to the same standard. I would vote to remove. But I admit \nto some level of doubt, and I think that I need to be honest about that \nbecause the pressures today to put party first are real on both sides \nof the aisle, and they are much more acute today than they were during \nWatergate.\n  It is with that reality as context that I prepare to vote today. I \nbelieve that the President's crimes are worthy of removal. I will vote \nto convict on both Articles of Impeachment.\n  But I know that something is rotten in the state of Denmark. Ours is \nan institution built to put country above party, and today we are \ndoing, often, the opposite. I believe within the cult of personality \nthat has become the Trump Presidency, the disease is more acute and \nmore perilous to the Nation's health on the Republican side of the \nledger, but I admit this affliction has spread to all corners of this \nChamber.\n  If we are to survive as a democracy--a fragile, delicate, constantly \nin need of tending democracy--then this Senate needs to figure out a \nway after today to reorder our incentive system and recalibrate our \nfaiths so that the health of one party never ever again comes before \nthe health of our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 46, "speaker_bioguide": "M001169", "itemno": 58}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue)", "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue).

Mr. President, the Constitution is at the foundation of \nour Republic's success, and we each strive not to lose sight of our \npromise to defend it.\n  The Constitution established a vehicle of impeachment that has \noccupied both Houses of our Congress these many days. We have labored \nto faithfully execute our responsibilities to it. We have arrived at \ndifferent judgments, but I hope we respect each other's good faith.\n  The allegations made in the Articles of Impeachment are very serious. \nAs a Senator juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial \njustice. I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I \nam. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential.\n  I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the President--\nthe leader of my own party--would be the most difficult decision I have \never faced. I was not wrong.\n  The House managers presented evidence supporting their case, and the \nWhite House counsel disputed that case.\n  In addition, the President's team presented three defenses: first, \nthat there could be no impeachment without a statutory crime; second, \nthat the Bidens' conduct justified the President's actions; and third, \nthat the judgment of the President's actions should be left to the \nvoters. Let me first address those three defenses.\n  The historic meaning of the words ``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' \nthe writings of the Founders, and my own reasoned judgment convinced me \nthat a President can indeed commit acts against the public trust that \nare so egregious that, while they are not statutory crimes, they would \ndemand removal from office.\n  To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all \nthe outrageous acts that a President might conceivably commit renders \nCongress powerless to remove such a President defies reason.\n  The President's counsel also notes that Vice President Biden appeared \nto have a conflict of interest when he undertook an effort to remove \nthe Ukrainian prosecutor general. If he knew of the exorbitant \ncompensation his son was receiving from a company actually under \ninvestigation, the Vice President should have recused himself. While \nignoring a conflict of interest is not a crime, it is surely very \nwrong.\n  With regard to Hunter Biden, taking excessive advantage of his \nfather's name is unsavory but also not a crime.\n  Given that in neither the case of the father nor the son was any \nevidence presented by the President's counsel that a crime had been \ncommitted, the President's insistence that they be investigated by the \nUkrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit. There \nis no question in my mind that were their names not Biden, the \nPresident would never have done what he did.\n  The defense argues that the Senate should leave the impeachment \ndecision to the voters. While that logic is appealing to our democratic \ninstincts, it is inconsistent with the Constitution's requirement that \nthe Senate, not the voters, try the President. Hamilton explained that \nthe Founders' decision to invest Senators with this obligation rather \nthan leave it to the voters was intended to minimize to the extent \npossible the partisan sentiments of the public at large. So the verdict \nis ours to render under our Constitution. The people will judge us for \nhow well and faithfully we fulfill our duty.\n  The grave question the Constitution tasks Senators to answer is \nwhether the President committed an act so extreme and egregious that it \nrises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. Yes, he did. The \nPresident asked a foreign government to investigate his political \nrival. The President withheld vital military funds from that government \nto press it to do so. The President delayed funds for an American ally \nat war with Russian invaders. The President's purpose was personal and \npolitical. Accordingly, the President is guilty of an appalling abuse \nof public trust.\n  What he did was not ``perfect.'' No, it was a flagrant assault on our \nelectoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values. \nCorrupting an election to keep one's self in office is perhaps the most \nabusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can \nimagine.\n  In the last several weeks, I have received numerous calls and texts. \nMany demanded, in their words, that I ``stand with the team.'' I can \nassure you that thought has been very much in my mind. You see, I \nsupport a great deal of what the President has done. I have voted with \nhim 80 percent of the time. But my promise before God to apply \nimpartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and \npolitical biases aside. Were I to ignore the evidence that has been \npresented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution \ndemands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose \nmy character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.\n  I am aware that there are people in my party and in my State who will \nstrenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters, I will be \nvehemently denounced. I am sure to hear abuse from the President and \nhis supporters. Does anyone seriously believe that I would consent to \nthese consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my \noath before God demanded it of me?\n  I sought to hear testimony from John Bolton, not only because I \nbelieve he could add context to the charges but also because I hoped \nthat what he might say could raise reasonable doubt and thus remove \nfrom me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment.\n  Like each Member of this deliberative body, I love our country. I \nbelieve that our Constitution was inspired by providence. I am \nconvinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality \nof our national character.\n  As it is with each Senator, my vote is an act of conviction. We have \ncome to different conclusions, fellow Senators, but I trust we have all \nfollowed the dictates of our conscience.\n  I acknowledge that my verdict will not remove the President from \noffice. The results of this Senate court will, in fact, be appealed to \na higher court--the judgment of the American people. Voters will make \nthe final decision, just as the President's lawyers have implored. My \nvote will likely be in the minority in the Senate. But irrespective of \nthese things, with my vote, I will tell my children and their children \nthat I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country \nexpected it of me.\n  I will only be one name among many--no more, no less--to future \ngenerations of Americans who look at the record of this trial. They \nwill note merely that I was among the Senators\n\n\nwho determined that what the President did was wrong, grievously wrong.\n  We are all footnotes at best in the annals of history, but in the \nmost powerful Nation on Earth, the Nation conceived in liberty and \njustice, that distinction is enough for any citizen.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 48, "speaker_bioguide": "R000615", "itemno": 60}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "The PRESIDING OFFICER", "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the past few weeks, \nwe have heard a lot of arguments, accusations, and anecdotes. Some very \nskilled speakers on both sides have presented their case both for and \nagainst impeachment.\n  I listened intently, hour after hour, day after day, to the House \nmanagers and the President's lawyers, and the word that kept coming to \nme, that I kept writing down in my notes was ``fairness'' because, you \nsee, here in America you are innocent until proven guilty.\n  As the President's defense team noted, ``[A]t the foundation of those \nauthentic forms of justice is fundamental fairness. It's playing by the \nrules. It's why we don't allow deflated footballs or stealing signs \nfrom the field. Rules are rules. They're there to be followed.''\n  You can create all the rhetorical imagery in the world, but without \nthe facts to prove guilt, it doesn't mean a thing. They can say the \nPresident cannot be trusted, but without proving why he can't be \ntrusted, their words are just empty political attacks.\n  You can speak of David v. Goliath, but if you were the one trying to \nsubvert the presumption of innocence, if you were the one to will facts \ninto existence, you are not David; you have become Goliath.\n  Our job here in the Senate is to ensure a fair trial based on the \nevidence gathered by the House. I have been accused, as have many of my \ncolleagues, of not wanting that fair trial. The exact opposite is true. \nWe have ensured a fair trial in the Senate after House Democrats abused \nhistorical precedents in their zeal to impeach a President they simply \ndo not like.\n  During prior impeachment proceedings in the last 50 years--lasting \naround 75 days or so in the House--the House's opposing party was \nallowed witnesses and the ability to cross-examine. This time, House \nRepublicans were locked out of the first 71 of 78 days. Let me say that \ndifferently. The ability to cross-examine the witnesses who are coming \nbefore the House against the President, the House Republicans and the \nPresident's team were not allowed to cross-examine those witnesses. The \nability to contradict and/or to cross-examine or have a conversation \nabout the evidence at the foundation of the trial? The White House \ncounsel and Republicans were not allowed. Think about the concept of \ndue process. The House Republicans and President's team, were not \nallowed for 71 of 78 days in the House. This is not a fair process. \nDoes that sound fair to you?\n  Democrats began talking about impeachment within months of President \nTrump's election and have made it clear that their No. 1 goal--perhaps \ntheir only goal--has been to remove him from office. Does that sound \nfair to you?\n  They have said: ``We are going to impeach the . . . '' and used an \nexpletive.\n  They said: ``We have to impeach him, otherwise he's going to win the \nelection.'' Now that might be the transparency we have been looking for \nin this process--the real root or foundation of why we found ourselves \nhere for 60 hours of testimony. It might be because, as they said \nthemselves, if we don't impeach him, he might just win.\n  What an amazing thought that the American people and not Members of \nCongress would decide the Presidency of the United States. What a novel \nconcept that the House managers and Congress would not remove his name \nfrom the ballot in 2020, but we would allow the American people to \ndecide the fate of this President and of the Presidency.\n  They don't get it. They don't understand that the American people \nshould be and are the final arbiters of what happens. They want to make \nnot only the President vulnerable, but they want to make Republican \nSenators vulnerable so that they can control the majority of the U.S. \nSenate because the facts are not winning for them. The facts are \nwinning for us because when you look at the facts, they are not their \nfacts and our facts, they are just the facts. What I have learned from \nwatching the House managers who were very convincing--they were very \nconvincing the first day--and after that what we realized was, some \nfacts mixed with a little fiction led to 100 percent deception. You \ncannot mix facts and fiction without having the premise of deceiving \nthe American public, and that is what we saw here in our Chamber.\n  Why is that the case? It is simple. When you look at the facts of \nthis Presidency, you come to a few conclusions that are, in fact, \nindisputable. One of those conclusions is that our economy is booming, \nand it is not simply booming from the top. When you start looking into \nthe crosstabs, as I like to say, what you find is that the bottom 20 \npercent are seeing increases that the top 20 percent are not seeing. So \nthis economy is working for the most vulnerable Americans, and that is \nchallenging to our friends on the other side.\n  When you think about the fact that the opportunity zone legislation \nsupported by this President is bringing $67 billion of private sector \ndollars into the most vulnerable communities, that is challenging to \nthe other side, but those, too, are facts. When you think about the \nessence of criminal justice reform and making communities safer and \nhaving a fairer justice system for those who are incarcerated, that is \nchallenging to the other side, but it is, indeed, a fact, driven home \nby the Republican Party and President Donald John Trump. These facts do \nhave consequences, just like elections.\n  Our friends on the other side, unfortunately, decided that if they \ncould not beat him at the polls, give Congress an opportunity to, in \nfact, impeach the President. My friends on the left simply don't want a \nfair process. This process has lacked fairness. Instead, they paint \ntheir efforts as fighting on behalf of democracy when, in fact, they \nare just working on behalf of Democrats. That is not fair. It is not \nwhat the American people deserve.\n  House managers said over and over again, the Senate had to protect \nour Nation's free and fair elections, but they are seeking to overturn \na fairly won election with absurd charges.\n  The House managers said over and over again that the Senate has to \nallow new witnesses so as to make the Senate trial fair, but they \ndidn't bother with the notion of fairness when they were in charge in \nthe House.\n  Their notion of fairness is to give the prosecution do-overs and \nextra latitude but not the defendants.\n  Actions speak louder than words, and the Democrats' actions have said \nall we need to hear.\n  Let's vote no on these motions today and get back to working for the \nAmerican people.", "turn": 50, "speaker_bioguide": "S001184", "itemno": 62}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "The PRESIDING OFFICER", "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the last time this body--the last time the \nSenate--debated the fate of a Presidency in the context of impeachment, \nthe legendary Senator from West Virginia, Robert Byrd, rose and said:\n\n       I think my country sinks beneath the yoke. It weeps, it \n     bleeds, and each new day a gash is added to her wounds.\n\n  Our country today, as then, is in pain. We are deeply divided, and \nmost days, it seems to me that we here are the ones wielding the shiv, \nnot the salve.\n  The Founders gave this Senate the sole power to try impeachments \nbecause, as Alexander Hamilton wrote: ``Where else than in the Senate \ncould have been found a tribunal sufficiently dignified, or \nsufficiently independent?''\n  I wish I could say with confidence that we here have lived up to the \nfaith our Founders entrusted in us. Unfortunately, I fear, in this \nimpeachment trial, the Senate has failed a historic test of our ability \nto put country over party.\n  Foreign interference in our democracy has posed a grave threat to our \nNation since its very founding. James Madison wrote that impeachment \nwas an ``indispensable'' check against a President who would ``betray \nhis trust to foreign powers.''\n  The threat of foreign interference remains grave and real to this \nday. It is indisputable that Russia attacked our 2016 election and \ninterfered in it broadly. President Trump's own FBI Director and \nDirector of National Intelligence have warned us they are intent\n\n\non interfering in our election this coming fall.\n  So, to my Republican colleagues, I have frankly found it difficult to \nunderstand why you would continue to so fervently support a President \nwho has repeatedly and publicly invited foreign interference in our \nelections.\n  During his 2016 campaign, Donald Trump looked straight into the \ncameras at a press conference and said: Russia, if you're listening, I \nhope you're able to find Secretary Clinton's 30,000 emails.\n  We now know with certainty that Russian military intelligence hackers \nfirst attempted to break into Secretary Clinton's office servers for \nthe first time that very day. Throughout his campaign, President Trump \npraised the publication of emails that Russian hackers had stolen from \nhis political opponent. He mercilessly attacked former FBI Director \nRobert Mueller throughout his investigation into the 2016 election and \nallegations of Russian interference.\n  Now we know, following this trial, that the day after Special Counsel \nMueller testified about his investigation to this Congress, President \nTrump, on a phone call with the President of Ukraine, asked for a \nfavor. He asked President Zelensky to announce an investigation of his \nchief political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and he asked \nfor an investigation into a Russian conspiracy theory about that DNC \nserver. In the weeks and the months since, he has repeated that Ukraine \nshould investigate his political opponent and that China should as \nwell.\n  During the trial here, after the House managers and President's \ncounsel made their presentation, Senators had the opportunity to ask \nquestions. I asked a question of the President's lawyers about a \nsentence in their own trial brief that stated: ``Congress has forbidden \nforeigners' involvement in American elections.''\n  I simply asked whether the President's own attorneys believed their \nclient, President Trump, agrees with that statement, and they refused \nto confirm that he does. And how could they when he has repeatedly \ninvited and solicited foreign interference in our elections?\n  So, to my colleagues: Do you doubt that President Trump did what he \nis accused of? Do you doubt he would do it again? Do you think for even \none moment he would refuse the help of foreign agents to smear any one \nof us if he thought it was in his best political interest? And I have \nto ask: What becomes of our democracy when elections become a no-holds-\nbarred blood sport, when our foreign adversaries become our allies, and \nwhen Americans of the opposing party become our enemies?\n  Throughout this trial, I have listened to the arguments of the House \nmanagers prosecuting the case against President Trump and of the \narguments of counsel defending the President. I engaged with colleagues \non both sides of the aisle and listened to their positions.\n  The President's counsel have warned us of danger in partisan \nimpeachments. They have cautioned that abuse of power--the first \narticle--is a difficult standard to define. They have expressed deep \nconcern about an impeachment conducted on the brink of our next \nPresidential election.\n  I understand those concerns and even share some of them. The House \nmanagers, in turn, warned us that our President has demonstrated a \nperilous willingness to seek foreign interference in our elections and \npresented significant evidence that the President withheld foreign aid \nfrom a vulnerable ally, not to serve our national interest but to \nattack a political opponent. They demonstrated the President has \ncategorically obstructed congressional investigations to cover up his \nmisconduct. These are serious dangers too.\n  We, then, are faced with a choice between serious and significant \ndangers. After listening closely to the evidence, weighing the \narguments, and reflecting on my constitutional responsibility and my \noath to do impartial justice, I have decided today I will vote guilty \non both articles.\n  I recognize that many of my colleagues have made up their minds. No \nmatter what decision you have reached, I think it is a sad day for our \ncountry. I myself have never been on a crusade to impeach Donald Trump, \nas has been alleged against all Democrats. I have sought ways to work \nacross the aisle with his administration, but in the years that have \nfollowed his election, I have increasingly become convinced our \nPresident is not just unconventional, not just testing the boundaries \nof our norms and traditions, but he is at times unmoored.\n  Throughout this trial, I have heard from Delawareans who are \nfrustrated the Senate refused to hear from witnesses or subpoena \ndocuments needed to uncover all the facts about the President's \nmisconduct. I have heard from Delawareans who fear our President \nbelieves he is above the law and that he acts as if he is the law. I \nhave also heard from Delawareans who just want us to find a way to work \ntogether.\n  It is my sincere regret that, with all the time we have spent \ntogether, we could not find common ground at all. From the opening \nresolution that set the procedures for trial adopted on a party-line \nbasis, the majority leader refused all attempts to make this a more \nopen and more fair process. Every Democrat was willing to have Chief \nJustice Roberts rule on motions to subpoena relevant witnesses and \ndocuments. Every Member of the opposing party refused. We could not \neven forge a consensus to call a single witness who has said he has \nfirsthand evidence, who is willing to testify and was even preparing to \nappear before us.\n  When an impeachment trial becomes meaningless, we are damaged and \nweakened as a body, and our Constitution suffers in ways not easily \nrepaired. We have a President who hasn't turned over a single scrap of \npaper in an impeachment investigation. Unlike Presidents Nixon and \nClinton before him, who directed their senior advisers and Cabinet \nofficials to cooperate, President Trump stonewalled every step of this \nCongress's impeachment inquiry and then personally attacked those who \ncooperated. The people who testified to the House of Representatives in \nspite of the President's orders are dedicated public servants and \ndeserve our thanks, not condemnation.\n  Where do we go from here? Well, after President Clinton's impeachment \ntrial, he said: ``This can be and must be a time of reconciliation and \nrenewal for [our country],'' and he apologized for the harm he had done \nto our Nation.\n  When President Nixon announced his resignation, he said: ``The first \nessential is to begin healing the wounds of this Nation.''\n  I wish President Trump would use this moment to bring our country \ntogether, to assure us he would work to make the 2020 election a fair \ncontest; that he would tell Russia and China to stay out of our \nelections; that he would tell the American people, whoever his opponent \nmight be, the fight will be between candidates, not families; that if \nhe loses, he will leave peacefully, in a dignified manner; and that if \nhe wins, he will work tirelessly to be the President for all people.\n  But at this point, some might suggest it would be hopelessly naive to \nexpect of President Trump that he would apologize or strive to heal our \ncountry or do the important work of safeguarding our next election. So \nthat falls to us.\n  To my colleagues who have concluded impeachment is too heavy a hammer \nto wield, if you believe the American people should decide the fate of \nthis President in the next election, what will you do to protect our \ndemocracy? What will you do to ensure the American people learn the \ntruth of what happened so that they can cast informed votes? Will you \ncosponsor bills to secure our elections? Will you insist they receive \nvotes on this floor? Will you express support for the intelligence \ncommunity that is working to keep our country safe? Will you ensure \nwhistleblowers who expose corruption are protected, not vilified? Will \nyou press this administration to cooperate with investigations and to \nallow meaningful accommodations so that Congress can have its power of \noversight? Why can we not do this together?\n  Each day of this trial, we have said the Pledge of Allegiance to our \ncommon Nation. For my Republican friends who have concluded the voters \nshould decide President Trump's fate, we need to do more together to \nmake that possible. Many of my Democratic friends, I know, are poised \nto do their very best to defeat President Trump at the ballot box.\n  So here is my plea--that we would find ways to work together to \ndefend\n\n\nour democracy and safeguard our next election. We have spent more time \ntogether here in the last few weeks than in the last few years. Imagine \nif we dedicated that same time to passing the dozens of bipartisan \nbills that have come over from the House that are awaiting action. \nImagine what we could accomplish for our States and our country if we \nactually tackled the challenges of affordable healthcare and ending the \nopioid crisis, making our schools and communities safer, and bridging \nour profound disagreements.\n  What fills me with dread, to my colleagues, is that each day we come \nto this floor and talk past each other and not to each other and fail \nto help our constituents.\n  Let me close by paraphrasing our Chaplain--Chaplain Black--whose \ndaily prayers brought me great strength in recent weeks: May we work \ntogether to bring peace and unity. May we permit Godliness to make us \nbold as lions. May we see a clear vision of our Lord's desire for our \nNation and remember we borrow our heartbeats from our Creator each day.", "turn": 52, "speaker_bioguide": "C001088", "itemno": 64}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "The PRESIDING OFFICER", "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the last several months and last \nseveral weeks, the American people have watched Washington convulse in \npartisan accusations, investigations, and endless acrimony. That \ndivision reached its high watermark as the U.S. Senate carried out the \nthird Presidential impeachment trial in our Nation's history.\n  We saw, over the last 2 weeks, an impeachment process that included \nthe testimony of 17 witnesses, more than 100 hours of testimony, and \ntens of thousands of pages of evidence, records, and documents, which I \nsuccessfully fought to make part of the record. I fought hard to extend \nthe duration of testimony to ensure that each side could be heard over \n6 days instead of just 4. But what we did not see over the last 2 weeks \nwas a conclusive reason to remove the President of the United States--\nan act which would nullify the 2016 election and rob roughly half the \ncountry of their preferred candidate for the 2020 elections.\n\n  House managers repeatedly stated that they had established \n``overwhelming evidence'' and an ``airtight'' case to remove the \nPresident. Yet they also repeatedly claimed they needed additional \ninvestigation and testimony. A case cannot be both ``overwhelming'' and \n``airtight'' and yet incomplete at the same time. That contradiction is \nnot mere semantics.\n  In their partisan--their partisan--race to impeach, the House failed \nto do the fundamental work required to prove its case, to meet the \nheavy burden. For the Senate to ignore this deficiency and conduct its \nown investigation would weaponize the impeachment power. A House \nmajority could simply short-circuit an investigation, impeach, and \ndemand the Senate complete the House's work--what they were asking us \nto do.\n  The Founders were concerned about this very point. Alexander Hamilton \nwrote, regarding impeachments: ``[T]here will always be the greatest \ndanger that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative \nstrength of parties, than by real demonstrations of innocence or \nguilt.''\n  More recently, Congressman Jerry Nadler, one of the House managers in \nthe trial, said:\n\n       There must never be a narrowly voted impeachment or an \n     impeachment substantially supported by one of our major \n     political parties and largely opposed by the other. Such an \n     impeachment will lack legitimacy.\n\n  Last March, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said: ``Impeachment is so divisive \nto the country that unless there's something so compelling and \noverwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path, \nbecause it divides the country.''\n  The Framers knew that partisan impeachments could lead to \nimpeachments over policy disagreements. Legal scholars like Charles \nBlack have written that policy differences are not grounds for \nimpeachment. But policy differences about corruption and the proper use \nof tax dollars are at the very heart of this impeachment. Nevertheless, \nthat disagreement led the House to deploy this most serious of \nconstitutional remedies.\n  The reason the Framers were concerned about partisan or policy \nimpeachments was their concern for the American people. Removing a \nPresident disenfranchises the American people. For a Senate of only 100 \npeople, to do that requires a genuine, bipartisan, national consensus. \nHere, especially only 9 months before an election, I cannot pretend the \npeople will accept this body removing a President who received nearly \n63 million votes without meeting that high burden.\n  The House managers' other argument to remove the President--\nobstruction of Congress--is an affront to the Constitution. The Framers \ncreated a system of government in which the legislative, executive, and \nthe judiciary are evenly balanced. The Framers consciously diluted each \nbranch's power, making all three separate but equal and empowered to \ncheck each other.\n  The obstruction charge assumes the House is superior to the executive \nbranch. In their zeal, the House managers would disempower the \njudiciary and demand that the House's interpretation of the sole power \nof impeachment be accepted by the Senate and the other branches without \nquestion. They claim no constitutional privilege exists to protect the \nexecutive branch against the legislature seeking impeachment. They go \nfurther and claim that a single Justice--a single Justice--exercising \nthe Senate's sole power to try impeachments, can actually strip the \nexecutive of its constitutional protections with a simple decree.\n  In Federalist 78, Hamilton wrote: ``[L]iberty can have nothing to \nfear from the judiciary alone, but would have everything to fear from \nits union with either of the other departments.''\n  If the House managers prevail, the House would have destroyed our \nconstitutional balance, declaring itself the arbiter of constitutional \nrights and conscripting the Chief Justice to do it.\n  To be clear, the executive branch is not immune from legislative \noversight or impeachment and trial, but that cannot come at the expense \nof constitutional rights--certainly not without input from the \njudiciary. After all, since Marbury v. Madison, ``[i]t is emphatically \nthe duty of the Judicial Department to say what the law is.'' Without \nthis separation, nothing stops the House from seeking privileged \ninformation under the guise of an impeachment inquiry.\n  But the House managers say that no matter how flimsy the House's \ncase, if the Executive tries to protect that information \nconstitutionally, that itself is an impeachable offense. That dangerous \nprecedent would weaken the stability of government--constantly \nthreatening the President with removal and setting the stage for a \nconstitutional crisis without recourse to the courts. With that \nprecedent set, the separation of powers would simply cease to exist.\n  Over the 244-year history of our country, no President has been \nremoved from office. The first Presidential impeachment occurred in \n1868. The next was more than 100 years later. Now, 50 percent of \nPresidents have been impeached in the last 25 years alone. A tool so \nrarely used in the past is now being used more frequently. It is a \ndangerous development, and the Senate stands as the safeguard as \npassions grow even more heated.\n  These defective articles and the defective process leading to them \nallow the House to muddy things and claim we are setting a destructive \nprecedent for the future.\n  Of course, bad cases make bad law. The House's decision to short-\ncircuit the investigation--moving faster than any Presidential \nimpeachment ever, and a wholly partisan one at that--certainly makes \nfor a bad case.\n  So, again, let me be clear about what this precedent does not do. At \nthe outset, this case does not set the precedent that a President can \ndo anything as long as he believes it to be in his electoral interest. \nI also reject the claim that impeachment requires criminal conduct. \nRather, this shows, first, that House committees cannot simply assume \nthe impeachment power to compel evidence without express authority from \nthe full body and corresponding political accountability.\n  Second, the House should work in good faith with the Executive \nthrough the accommodation process. If that process reaches an impasse, \nthe House should seek the assistance of the judicial branch before \nturning to impeachment.\n\n\n  Finally, when Articles of Impeachment come to the Senate along \npartisan lines, when nearly half of the people appear unmoved and \nmaintain adamant support for the President and when the country is just \nmonths away from an election, in these circumstances, the American \npeople would likely not accept removing the President, and the Senate \ncan wisely decline to usurp the people's power to elect their own \nPresident.\n  It has been said in this trial that the American people cannot make \nthat decision for themselves. I couldn't disagree more. I believe in \nthe American people. I believe in the power of our people to evaluate \nthe President, to make their decision in November, and to move forward \nin our enduring effort to form a more perfect union. I do not believe a \nSenate nullification of two elections over defective Impeachment \nArticles is in the Nation's best interest.\n  So let's move forward with the people's business and bring this \nNation back together. Let's rise up together, not fight each other. Not \nall of us voted for President Trump. Not all of us voted for the last \nPresident or the one before him. Yet we should work to make our Nation \nsuccessful regardless of partisan passions. Passion, positively placed, \nwill provide our Nation with the prosperity it has always been blessed \nwith. Partisan poison will prove devastating to our Nation's long-term \nprosperity.\n  We must not allow our fractures to destroy our national fabric or \npartisanship to destroy our friendships. If we come together, we will \nsucceed together, for surely we are bound together in this, the great \nUnited States of America.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 54, "speaker_bioguide": "G000562", "itemno": 66}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "The PRESIDING OFFICER", "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I entered the Senate in the wake of \nWatergate in 1975, a time when the American people's faith in our \ninstitutions was profoundly shaken. The very first vote I cast was in \nfavor of creating the Select Committee to Study Government Operations \nwith Respect to Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans--\nthat is, the Church Committee. Through that Committee's work, the \nAmerican public soon learned of years of abuses that had occurred at \nthe hands of the executive branch's intelligence agencies. In response, \nthe Senate passed sweeping reforms to rein in this overreach. In many \nways, this represented the best of the Senate: we came together across \nparty lines to thoroughly investigate, and ultimately curb, gross \nexecutive branch abuses.\n  The Senate has never been perfect. And much has changed in the 45 \nyears I have served in this body. Yet today we face a similar test: \nwhether the Senate, in the face of egregious misconduct directed by the \nPresident himself, will rise again to serve as the check on executive \nabuses our Founders intended us to be.\n  But today, and throughout this ``trial,'' we are failing this test \nand witnessing the very worst of the modern Senate. After being \nconfronted with overwhelming evidence of a brazen abuse of executive \npower, and an equally brazen attempt to keep that scheme hidden from \nCongress and the American people, the Senate is poised to look the \nother way. To simply move on. To pretend the Senate has no \nresponsibility to reveal the President's misconduct and, God forbid, \nhold him to account.\n  Indeed we are being told the Senate has no constitutional role to \nplay, and only the American people should judge the President's \nmisconduct in the next election. This is despite the Senate's \nconstitutionally-mandated role, and despite the fact that the \nPresident's scheme was aimed at cheating in that very election. And now \nthe Senate is cementing a cover-up of the President's misconduct, to \nkeep its extent hidden from the American people. How, then, will the \nAmerican people be equipped to judge the President's actions? How far \nthe Senate has fallen.\n  In some ways, President Nixon's misconduct--directing a break-in of \nthe Democratic National Committee headquarters to benefit himself \npolitically--seems quaint compared to what we face today. As charged in \nArticle I, President Trump secretly directed a sweeping, illegal scheme \nto withhold $400 million in military aid from an ally at war in order \nto extort that ally into announcing investigations of his political \nopponent to boost his re-election. Then, instead of hiding select \nincriminating records, as President Nixon did, President Trump \nattempted to hide every single record from the American people. As \nreflected in Article II, President Trump has the distinction of being \nthe only president in our nation's history to direct all executive \nbranch officials not to cooperate with a congressional investigation.\n  I want to be clear: I did not relish the prospect of an impeachment \ntrial. I have stark disagreements with this President on issues of \npolicy and the law, on morality and honesty. But it is for the American \npeople to judge a president on those matters. Today is not about \ndifferences over policy. It is about the integrity of our elections, \nand it is about the Constitution.\n  The Constitution cannot not protect itself. During this trial, the \nwords of Washington, Madison, Jefferson, Hamilton, and Lincoln have \nfrequently been invoked on behalf of our Constitution. Now it is our \nturn to record our names in defense of our democracy.\n  In Federalist No. 65, Alexander Hamilton described impeachment as the \nremedy for ``the abuse or violation of some public trust.'' Although \nthat definition has guided the nation for 230 years, President Trump's \ncounsels would have us rely on a very different definition.\n  The central arguments presented by the President's defense team were \nstunning. The President argues that we cannot convict him because abuse \nof power is not impeachable. He can abuse his power to benefit his re-\nelection, and engage in improper quid pro quos, so long he believes his \nre-election is in the national interest. King Louis XIV of France--who \nfamously declared ``I am the State''--might approve of that reasoning, \nbut the Senate should condemn it. The President and his attorneys even \nargue that a president may welcome and even request foreign governments \nto ``dig up dirt'' on their opponents with impunity. Yet not only are \nsuch requests illegal, they violate the very premise of our democracy--\nthat American elections are decided only by Americans.\n  The Senate should flatly reject the President's brazen and dangerous \narguments. But an acquittal today will do the opposite. If you believe \nthat the President's outlandish arguments are irrelevant after today, \nand will have no lasting impact on our democracy, remember this: The \nPresident's counsel's claim that abuse of power is not impeachable is \nlargely--and mistakenly--based on the argument of another counsel, \nJustice Benjamin Curtis, defending another president from impeachment, \nPresident Johnson. That was 150 years ago.\n  What we do today will set a weighty precedent. An acquittal today--\ndespite the overwhelming evidence of guilt, and following a sham of a \ntrial--may fundamentally, and perhaps irreparably, distort our system \nof checks and balances for another 150 years.\n  And what a sham trial it was. The fact that this body would not call \na uniquely critical witness who has declared his willingness to \ntestify, John Bolton, is beyond outrageous. And why? To punish the \nHouse for not taking years to first litigate a subpoena and then \nlitigate every line of testimony? Or is it because testimony detailing \nthis corrupt scheme, no matter how damning, would not alter the \nMajority Leader's pre-ordained acquittal?\n  The Senate had a constitutional obligation to try this impeachment \nimpartially. Yet the Senate willfully blinded itself to evidence that \nwill soon be revealed. Senate Republicans even defeated a motion merely \nto consider and debate whether to seek critical documents and key \nwitnesses. The notion that the Senate could retain the title of the \n``world's greatest deliberative body'' following this charade rings \nhollow.\n  It is often said that history is watching. I expect that's true. But \nin this moment we are not merely witnesses to history--we are writing \nit. It is ours to shape. And let me briefly describe the dark chapters \nwe are inscribing in the story of our republic today.\n  In his farewell address, George Washington warned us that ``foreign \ninfluence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government.'' \nYet, as a candidate, President Trump famously requested that Russia \nhack his political\n\n\nopponent's emails. Hours later, Russia did. The President then \nweaponized Russia's criminal influence campaign, which resulted in an \ninvestigation that uncovered a morass of inappropriate contacts with \nRussians, lies to cover them up, multiple instances of the President's \nobstruction of justice, and 37 other indictments and convictions. Yet, \nafter the saga concluded, the President felt liberated. Literally the \nday after Special Counsel Robert Mueller testified, the President asked \nthe Ukrainian president ``for a favor.'' He has since publicly repeated \nhis request for Ukraine to intervene in our election, and made the same \nrequest to China, on national television.\n  All of us must ask: If we acquit President Trump today, what will he \ndo tomorrow? None of us knows. But two things I am confident of: \nPresident Trump's willingness to abuse his office, and his eagerness to \nexploit foreign interference in our elections, will only grow. And, \ncrucially, Congress's capacity to do anything about it will be \ncrippled.\n  While the President's lawyers stood on the Senate floor and \nadmonished the House Managers for failing to litigate each subpoena in \ncourt to exhaustion, he had other lawyers in court making the mutually \nexclusive argument that Article III courts have no jurisdiction to \nsettle disputes between our two branches. Such duplicity would put the \ntwo-faced Roman God Janus to shame. Meanwhile, the President's \nDepartment of Justice claims not only that President Trump cannot be \nindicted while in office, he cannot even be investigated.\n  But don't worry, the President's lawyers promise us, the President is \nstill not above the law because Congress can hold him in check through \nour confirmation power and power of the purse. Neither would come close \nto checking a lawless executive. It is well known that the President \nhas effectively stopped nominating senior officials in his \nadministration. He has now set a modern record for acting cabinet \nsecretaries. The President has said that he prefers having acting \nofficials, who bypass Senate scrutiny, because they are easier to \ncontrol.\n  More crucially, with this vote today, we inflict grave damage on our \npower of the purse. I am the Vice Chairman of Appropriations, a \nCommittee on which I have served for 40 years. Members of this \nCommittee not only write the spending bills, they are the guardians of \nthis body's power of the purse, granted exclusively to Congress by the \nFounders to counter ``all the overgrown prerogatives of the other \nbranches.'' The Framers, having broken free from the grip of a \nmonarchy, feared an unchecked executive who would use public dollars \nlike a king: as a personal slush fund. Yet this is precisely what \nPresident Trump has done.\n  If we fail to hold President Trump accountable for illegally freezing \ncongressionally appropriated military aid to extract a personal favor, \nwhat would stop him from freezing disaster aid to states hit by \nhurricanes and flooding until governors or home state senators agree to \nendorse him? What would stop any future president from holding any part \nof the $4.7 trillion budget hostage to their personal whims? The answer \nis nothing. We will have relinquished the very check that the Founders \nentrusted to us to ensure a president could never behave like a king.\n  The President's defense team also argued that impeachment is \ninappropriate unless it is fully bipartisan. Decades ago, I questioned \nwhether an impeachment would be accepted if not bipartisan. But this \nargument has revealed itself to be painfully flawed. In 1974, \nRepublicans ultimately convinced President Nixon to resign; in 1999, \nDemocrats condemned President Clinton's private misconduct and \nsupported a formal censure. In contrast, with one important exception, \nPresident Trump's supporters have thus far shown no limits in their \ntolerance of overwhelming misconduct; they even chased out of their \nparty a Congressman who stood up to the President. Indeed, a \nprerequisite for membership in the Republican Party today appears to be \nthe belief that he can do no wrong. Under this standard, claiming that \nPresident Trump's impeachment would only be valid if it were supported \nby his most unflinching enablers renders the impeachment clause null \nand void.\n  That said, I do understand the immense pressure my Republican friends \nare under to support this President. I know well how much easier it is \nfor me to express my disgust and disappointment that the President has \nproven himself so unfit for his office. That is one reason why I feel \nit is important to make a commitment right now. If any president, \nRepublican or Democrat, uses the power of his or her office to extort a \nforeign nation to interfere in our elections to do the president's \ndomestic political bidding, I will support their impeachment and \nremoval. It is wrong, no matter the party. And we all should say so.\n  Before I close, I want to thank the brave individuals who shared \ntheir testimony with both the House of Representatives and American \npeople. Each of these witnesses served this President in his \nadministration. And they have served their country. They witnessed \nmisconduct originating in the highest office in world, and they spoke \nup. They did not hide behind the President's baseless order not to \ncooperate. Most knew that by stepping forward they would be attacked by \nthe President and some of his vindictive defenders. Yet they came \nforward anyway. We owe them our enduring appreciation. They give me \nhope for tomorrow.\n  Yet today is a dark day for our democracy. And what frightens me most \nis this: We are currently on a dangerous road, and no one has any idea \nwhere this road will take us. Not one of us here knows. But we all know \nour democracy has been indelibly altered.\n  The notion that the President has learned his lesson is farcical. The \nPresident's lead counsel opened and closed this trial by claiming the \nPresident did nothing wrong. The President himself describes his \nactions as ``perfect.'' On 75 separate occasions, including yesterday, \nhe's claimed he's done nothing wrong. Lord help us if the Senate \nagrees. The only lesson the President has learned from this trial is \nhow easily he can get away with egregious, illegal misconduct.\n  If the Senate does not recognize the gravity of President Trump's \n``violation of the public trust,'' and hold him accountable, we will \nhave seen but a preview of what is to come. Foreign interference in our \nelections. Total noncompliance with lawful congressional oversight. \nDisregard of our constitutional power of the purse. Open, flagrant \ncorruption. I fear there is no bottom.\n  This is the tragic result of the Senate failing its constitutional \nduty to hold a real trial. We will leave President Trump ``sacred and \ninviolable'' and with ``no constitutional tribunal to which he is \namenable; no punishment to which he can be subjected without involving \nthe crisis of a national revolution.'' As Hamilton warned over two \ncenturies ago, that is not a president; that is a king. I, for one, \nwill not merely ``get over it.''\n  I have listened very carefully to both sides over the past two weeks. \nThe record has established, leaving no doubt in my view, that President \nTrump directed the most impeachable, corrupt scheme by any president in \nthis country's history. To protect our constitutional republic, and to \nsafeguard our government's system of checks and balances, my oath to \nour Constitution compels me to hold the President of the United States \naccountable.\n  I will vote to convict and remove President Donald J.

Mr. President, over the past 2 weeks, my colleagues and I \nhave patiently listened to arguments from both the House managers and \nthe President's counsel right here in the Senate regarding a grave \nallegation from the House that the President has committed an act \nworthy of impeachment.\n  As a Senator, I believe that the first and perhaps most important \nconsideration is whether abuse of power and obstruction of Congress are \nimpeachable offenses as asserted by our House managers.\n  Impeachment is a necessary and essential component of our \nConstitution. It serves as an important check on civil officers who \ncommit crimes against the United States. However, our Founding Fathers \nwere wise to ensure that the impeachment and the\n\n\nconviction of a sitting President would not be of partisan intent. \nSince President Trump took office, many have sought to delegitimize his \nPresidency with partisan attacks. We have heard this right here in the \nSenate, and we have experienced it. This extreme effort to unseat the \nPresident, I believe, is unjustified and intolerable.\n  Now that the Senate has heard and studied the arguments from both \nsides, I believe the lack of merit in the House managers' case is \nevident. The outcome of the impeachment trial is a foregone conclusion. \nAcquittal is the judgment the Senate should and, I believe, will \nrender--and soon.\n  For my part, I have weighed the House managers' case and found it \nwanting in fundamental aspects. I will try to explain.\n  I believe that their case does not allege an impeachable offense. \nEven if the facts are as they have stated, the managers have failed, I \nbelieve, as a matter of constitutional law, to meet the exceedingly \nhigh bar for removal of the President as established by our Founding \nFathers, the Framers of the Constitution.\n  In their wisdom, the Framers rejected vague grounds for impeachment--\noffenses like we have heard here, ``maladministration''--for fear that \nit would, in the words of Madison, result in a Presidential ``tenure \nduring [the] pleasure of the Senate.''\n  ``Abuse of power,'' one of the charges put forward here by the House \nmanagers, is a concept as vague and susceptible to abuse, I believe, as \n``maladministration.'' If you take just a minute or two to look at the \ndefinitions of ``abuse'' and ``mal,'' they draw distinct similarities. \n``Mal,'' a prefix of Latin origin, means bad, evil, wrong. ``Abuse,'' \nalso of Latin origin, means to wrongly use or to use for a bad effect. \nThere is a kinship between ``mal'' and ``abuse.''\n  As the Framers rejected in their wisdom ``maladministration,'' I \nbelieve that they, too, would reject the noncriminal ``abuse of \npower.'' Instead, the Framers, as the Presiding Officer knows, provided \nfor impeachment only in a few limited cases: treason, bribery, and high \ncrimes and misdemeanors. Only those offenses justify taking the dire \nstep of removing a duly elected President from office and permanently \ntaking his name off the ballot.\n  This institution, the U.S. Senate, I believe, should not lower the \nconstitutional bar and authorize their theory of impeachment for abuse \nof power. It is simply not an impeachable offense, in my judgment. \nTheir criteria for removal centers not on the President's actions but \non their loose perception of his motivations. If the Senate endorses \nthis approach, we will dramatically transform the impeachment power as \nwe have known it over the years. We will forever turn this grave \nconstitutional power into a tool for adjudicating policy disputes and \npolitical disagreements among all of us. The Framers, in their wisdom, \ncautioned us against this dangerous path, and I believe the Senate will \nheed their warning.\n  The other article, the House managers' obstruction of Congress claim, \nis similarly flawed. Congress's investigative and oversight powers are \ncritical tools, and we use them in ensuring our system of checks and \nbalances. But those powers are not absolute.\n  The President, too, as head of a coequal branch of government, enjoys \ncertain privileges and immunities from congressional factfinding. That \nis his constitutional right and has been the right of former Presidents \nfrom both parties. The President's mere assertion of privileges and \nimmunities is not an impeachable offense. Endorsing otherwise would be \nunprecedented and would ignore the past practices of administrations of \nboth parties. Adopting otherwise would drastically undermine the \nseparation of powers enshrined in our Constitution.\n  This was not what our Framers intended. Nowhere in the Constitution \nor in the Federal statute is abuse of power or obstruction of Congress \nlisted as a crime--nowhere. What constitutes an impeachable offense is \nnot left to the discretion of the Congress. We cannot expand, I \nbelieve, on the scope of actions that could be deemed impeachable \nbeyond that which the Framers intended.\n  What we really have here, I believe, is nothing more than the abuse \nof the power of impeachment itself by the Democratic House. Doesn't our \ncountry deserve better? The President certainly deserves better.\n  Today I am proud to stand and repudiate those very weak impeachment \nefforts, and I will accordingly vote to acquit the President on both \narticles.\n  My hope is that, in the future, Congress will reject this episode \nand, instead, choose to be guided by the Constitution and the words \nfrom our Framers.\n  Basically, I believe it is a time to move on. We know that the \nAmerican economy is booming. The United States is projecting strength \nand promoting peace abroad. The President is unbowed. I believe the \nAmerican people see all of this. At the end of the day, the ultimate \njudgment rests in their hands. In my judgment, that is just as it \nshould be.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 58, "speaker_bioguide": "S000320", "itemno": 70}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "The PRESIDING OFFICER", "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Benjamin Franklin knew the strength of our \nConstitution, but he also knew its vulnerability. His words, oft \nrepeated on this floor--``a republic, if you can keep it''--were a \nstark warning. Franklin believed every generation could face the \nchallenge of protecting and defending our Nation's liberty-affirming \ndocument.\n  We know this personally. Before we can legally serve as Senators, we \nmust publicly swear an oath to support and defend the Constitution of \nthe United States. A trial of impeachment, more than any other Senate \nassignment, tests the oath each one of us takes before the people of \nthis Nation.\n  The President's legal team warns us of the danger of impeachment and \nconviction. They tell us to think carefully about what the removal of a \nduly elected President could mean for our democracy. But if we should \nhave our eyes wide open to the danger of conviction, we also cannot \nignore the danger of acquittal. The facts of this impeachment are well \nknown, and many Republicans concede that they are likely true. They \nbelieve as I do, that President Trump pressured the Ukrainian President \nby withholding vital military aid and a prized White House visit in \nreturn for the announcement of an investigation of the Bidens and the \nRussian-concocted CrowdStrike fantasy.\n  Some of these same Republicans acknowledge that what the President \ndid was ``inappropriate.'' At least one has used the word \n``impeachable.'' But many say they are still going to vote to acquit \nhim regardless. So let's open our eyes to the morning after a judgment \nof acquittal. Facing a well-established election siege by Russia and \nother enemies of the United States, we, the Senate, will have absolved \na President who continues to brazenly invite foreign interference in \nour elections. Expect more of the same.\n  A majority of this body will have voted for the President's argument \nthat inviting interference by a foreign government is not impeachable \nif it serves the President's personal political interests.\n  We will also have found for the first time in the history of this \nNation that an impeachment proceeding in the Senate can be conducted \nwithout any direct witnesses or evidence presented on either side of \nthe case and that a President facing impeachment can ignore subpoenas \nto produce documents or witnesses to Congress.\n  Alexander Hamilton described the Senate as the very best venue for an \nimpeachment trial because it is ``independent and dignified,'' in his \nwords. When the Senate voted 51 to 49 against witnesses and evidence, \nthose 51 raised into question any claim to independence or dignity.\n  In addition, an acquittal will leave the extreme views stated by the \nPresident's defense counsel Alan Dershowitz unchallenged: first, that \nabuse of power is not an impeachable offense; second, that the \nimpeachment charges against the President were constitutionally \ninsufficient; and, third, his most dangerous theory, that unless the \nPresident has committed an actual crime, his conduct cannot be corrupt \nor impeachable as long as he believes it was necessary for his \nreelection.\n  By this logic, Professor Dershowitz would have excused Richard \nNixon's ordering of IRS audits of his political enemies. Mr. Dershowitz \nhas created an\n\n\nescape clause to impeachment, which is breathtaking in its impact and \nunfounded in our legal history.

The phrase ``high \n     Crimes and Misdemeanors'' is a term of art consciously \n     adopted by the drafters of the American constitution from \n     Great Britain. Beginning in 1386, the term was frequently \n     used by Parliament to describe the wide variety of conduct, \n     much of it non-criminal abuses of official power, for which \n     British officials were impeached.\n       The phrase ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' was introduced \n     into the American constitution by George Mason, who explained \n     the necessity for expanding impeachment beyond ``treason and \n     bribery'' by drawing his colleagues' attention to the ongoing \n     parliamentary impeachment trial of Warren Hastings. Hastings \n     was charged with a long list of abuses of power that his \n     articles of impeachment labeled ``high crimes and \n     misdemeanors,'' but which even his chief prosecutor, Edmund \n     Burke, admitted were not prosecutable crimes. On George \n     Mason's motion, the Philadelphia convention wrote into our \n     constitution the same phrase Parliament used to describe \n     Hastings' non-criminal misconduct.\n       No convention delegate ever suggested that impeachment be \n     limited to violations of criminal law. Multiple founders \n     emphasized the need for impeachment to extend to plainly non-\n     criminal conduct. For example, James Madison and George \n     Nicholas said that abuses of the pardon power should be \n     impeachable. Edmund Randolph believed that violation of the \n     foreign emoluments clause would be.\n       Thus, Alexander Hamilton's famous observation in Federalist \n     65 that impeachable offenses ``are of a nature which may with \n     peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate \n     chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself'' \n     was not merely an advocate's rhetorical flourish, but a well-\n     informed description of the shared understanding of those who \n     wrote and ratified the Constitution.\n       Since ratification, one senator and multiple judges have \n     been impeached for non-criminal behavior. The first federal \n     official impeached, convicted, and removed for ``high crimes \n     and misdemeanors'' was Judge John Pickering, whose offenses \n     were making bad legal rulings, being drunk on the bench, and \n     taking the name of the Supreme Being in vain.\n       Among presidents, the tenth and eleventh articles of \n     impeachment against President Andrew Johnson charged non-\n     criminal misconduct. The first and second articles of \n     impeachment against President Richard Nixon approved by the \n     House Judiciary Committee allege both criminal and non-\n     criminal conduct, and the third alleges non-criminal \n     obstruction of Congress. Indeed, the Nixon House Judiciary \n     Committee issued a report in which it specifically rejected \n     the contention that impeachable conduct must be criminal.\n       The consensus of scholarly opinion is that impeachable \n     conduct does not require proof of crime.\n\n\n      abuse of power is an impeachable high crime and misdemeanor\n\n       It has been suggested that abuse of power is not an \n     impeachable high crime and misdemeanor. The reverse is true. \n     The British Parliament invented impeachment as a legislative \n     counterweight to abuses of power by the Crown and its \n     ministers. The American Framers inserted impeachment into our \n     constitution primarily out of concern about presidential \n     abuse of power. They inserted the phrase ``high crimes and \n     misdemeanors'' into the definition of impeachable conduct in \n     order to cover non-criminal abuses of power of the type \n     charged against Warren Hastings.\n       As Edmund Randolph observed at the Constitutional \n     Convention, ``the propriety of impeachments was a favorite \n     principle with him'' because ``[t]he Executive will have \n     great opportunities of abusing his power.'' In Federalist 65, \n     Hamilton defined ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' as ``those \n     offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, \n     in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public \n     trust.''\n       This understanding has often been expressed in the ensuing \n     centuries. For example, in 1926, the House voted to impeach \n     U.S. District Judge George English. The Judiciary Committee \n     report on the matter reviewed the authorities and concluded:\n       Thus, an official may be impeached for offenses of a \n     political character and for gross betrayal of public \n     interests. Also, for abuses or betrayals of trusts, for \n     inexcusable negligence of duty [or] for the tyrannical abuse \n     of power.\n       Two of the three prior presidential impeachment crises have \n     involved charges of abuse of power. The eleventh article of \n     impeachment against President Andrew Johnson alleged that he \n     abused his power by attempting to prevent implementation of \n     reconstruction legislation passed by Congress in March 1867, \n     and thus violated Article II, Section 3, of the constitution \n     by failing to ``take care that the laws be faithfully \n     executed.'' The second article of impeachment against Richard \n     Nixon charged a litany of abuses of presidential power, \n     including ``interfering with agencies of the Executive \n     Branch.''\n       Even if no precedent existed, the constitutional logic of \n     impeachment for abuse of presidential power is plain. The \n     president is granted wide powers under the constitution. The \n     framers recognized that a great many misuses of those powers \n     might violate no law, but nonetheless pose immense danger to \n     the constitutional order. They consciously rejected the idea \n     that periodic elections were a sufficient protection against \n     this danger and inserted impeachment as a remedy.\n       The consensus of scholarly opinion is that abuse of power \n     is an impeachable ``high crime and misdemeanor.''\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 74}, {"kind": "title", "speaker": "None", "text": "  A PRESIDENT MAY NOT ABUSE HIS POWERS OF OFFICE TO SECURE HIS OWN RE-", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 75}, {"kind": "title", "speaker": "None", "text": "                                ELECTION\n\n       Finally, one of President Trump's attorneys has suggested \n     that so long as a president believes his re-election is in \n     the public interest, ``if a president did something that he \n     believes will help get him elected, in the public interest, \n     that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in his \n     impeachment.'' It is true that merely because a president \n     makes a policy choice he believes will have beneficial \n     political effects, that choice is not necessarily \n     impeachable. However, if a President employs his powers in a \n     way that cannot reasonably be explained except as a means of \n     promoting his own reelection, the president's private \n     conviction that his maintenance of power is for the greater \n     good does not insulate him from impeachment. To accept such a \n     view would be to give the president carte blanche to corrupt \n     American electoral democracy.\n       Distinguishing between minor misuses of presidential \n     authority and grave abuses requiring impeachment and removal \n     is not an exact science. That is why the Constitution assigns \n     the task, not to a court, but to Congress, relying upon its \n     collective wisdom to assess whether a president has committed \n     a ``high crime and misdemeanor'' requiring his conviction and \n     removal.\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 76}, {"kind": "title", "speaker": "None", "text": "                              SIGNATORIES\n\n       Frank O.

Yet a verdict of acquittal by the Senate blesses the \nprofessor's torturous reasoning. An acquittal verdict would also give \nPresident Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani a pat on the back to \ncontinue his global escapades, harassing American Ambassadors whose \nservice he distrusts, and lounging at European cigar bars with an \nentourage of post-Soviet amigos.\n  More than anything, a verdict of acquittal says a majority of the \nSenate believes this President is above the law and cannot be held \naccountable for conduct abusing the powers of his office. And make no \nmistake, this President believes that is true.\n  On July 23--2 days before his phone call with President Zelensky--\nPresident Trump spoke to a group of young supporters and he said: ``I \nhave an Article II, where I have the right to do whatever I want as \npresident.''\n  This is the dangerous principle that President Trump and his lawyers \nare asking us, with a verdict of acquittal, to accept. Under the oath I \nhave sworn, I cannot.\n  What does it say of this Congress and our Nation that in 3 years, we \nhave become so anesthetized to outrage that, for a majority in this \nSenate, there is nothing--nothing--this President can do or say that \nrises to the level of blushworthy, let alone impeachable?\n  Nearly 6 years ago, I traveled to Ukraine with a bipartisan group of \nSenate colleagues led by John McCain. It was one of John's whirlwind \nvisits where we crammed 5 days' worth of meetings into 48 hours. We \narrived in Kyiv on March 14, 2014. It was bitterly cold. Ukrainians had \njust ousted a corrupt, Russian-backed leader who looted the national \ntreasury and hollowed out their nation's military. They had done so by \ntaking to the streets, risking their lives for democracy and a better \nfuture. More than 100 ordinary citizens in Kyiv had been killed by \nsecurity forces of the old government simply because they were \nprotesting for democracy.\n  Seeing Ukraine in a fragile democratic transition, Vladimir Putin \npounced on them, ordered an invasion and occupied Crimea. Putin and his \nthinly disguised Russian thugs were on the verge of seizing Donetsk in \nthe east.\n  I asked the Prime Minister what Ukraine needed to defend itself. He \nsaid:\n\n       Everything. We don't have anything that floats, flies or \n     runs.\n\n  Many may not appreciate how devastating Russia's war on Ukraine has \nbeen to that struggling young democracy. Their costly battle with \nRussia was for a principle that is really basic to America's national \nsecurity as well.\n  In a country with one-eighth of our population, more Ukrainian troops \nhave died defending Ukraine from Russia than American troops have \nperished in Afghanistan.\n  During the months President Trump illegally withheld military aid, as \nmany as two dozen Ukrainian soldiers were killed in battle. By \nwithholding security aid from Ukraine for President Trump's personal \npolitical benefit, he endangered the security of a fragile democracy.\n  Can there be any deeper betrayal of a President's responsibility than \nto endanger our national security and the security of an ally for his \nown personal political gain?\n  And to those of my colleagues who describe the President's conduct as \nmerely ``inappropriate,'' I disagree. Disparaging John McCain's service \nto our country is disgusting and inappropriate. What this President has \ndone to Ukraine crosses that line. It is impeachable.\n  I will close by remembering two public servants who, like us, were \ncalled by history to judge a President. Tom Railsback passed away as \nthis impeachment proceeding began. He was 2 days shy of his 88th \nbirthday. I knew Tom. I considered him a friend.\n  In 1974, Tom was a Republican Congressman from Moline, IL, and a \nmember of the House Judiciary Committee. He regarded President Nixon as \na political friend. He believed that Richard Nixon had achieved much \nfor America, including the opening of the door to China.\n  After studying the Watergate evidence closely, Congressman Railsback \ncame to believe that Richard Nixon had violated the Constitution. When \nPresident Nixon refused to turn over records and recordings requested \nby Congress, Tom Railsback took to the House floor to say: ``If the \nCongress doesn't get the material we think we need and then votes to \nexonerate, we'll be regarded as a paper tiger.''\n  When he voted to impeach President Nixon, Tom believed it was \nprobably the end of his career, but he was elected four more times. To \nhis dying day, Tom Railsback was proud of his vote. He voted for his \ncountry above his party.\n  Bill Cohen--also a Republican--was a freshman Congressman at the time \nand a member of the House Judiciary Committee. He studied the evidence \nwith Tom Railsback and then worked with him to draft Articles of \nImpeachment.\n  Bill Cohen received death threats, and he thought his votes to \nimpeach President Nixon would be the end of his political career. But \nhe went on to a distinguished career in the House, three terms in the \nSenate, and served as Secretary of Defense.\n  Listen to what Bill Cohen said recently of President's Trump's \nactions:\n\n       This is presidential conduct that you want to be ashamed \n     of. He is corrupting institutions, politicizing the military, \n     and acts like he is THE law.\n\n  And then Cohen added:\n\n       If [the President's conduct] is acceptable, we really don't \n     have a Republic as we've known it any more.\n\n  May I respectfully say to my Senate colleagues, Ben Franklin warned \nus of this day.\n  I will vote guilty on both Articles of Impeachment against President \nDonald John Trump, on article I abuse of power and article II \nobstruction of Congress. But at this moment of high constitutional \ndrama, I hope my last words can be a personal appeal to my Senate \ncolleagues.\n  Last night, many of us attended a State of the Union Address which \nwas as emotionally charged as any I have\n\n\never attended. As divided as our Nation may be and as divided as the \nSenate may be, we should remember America has weathered greater storms \nthan this impeachment and our current political standoff.\n  It was Abraham Lincoln, in the darkness of our worst storm, who \ncalled on us ``to strive on to finish the work we are in, to work to \nbind the nation's wounds.''\n  After this vote and after this day, those of us who are entrusted \nwith this high office must each do our part to work to bind the wounds \nof our divided nation. I hope we can leave this Chamber with that \ncommon resolve.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 61, "speaker_bioguide": "D000563", "itemno": 78}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "The PRESIDING OFFICER", "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me just begin with a note of optimism. \nYou are going to get to pick the next President, not a bunch of \npoliticians driven by sour grapes. I don't say that lightly. I didn't \nvote for President Trump. I voted for somebody I wouldn't know if they \nwalked in the door. But I accepted the fact that he won. That has been \nhard for a lot of people to do. And it is not like I am above the \nPresident being investigated.\n  I supported the Mueller investigation. I had Democratic colleagues \ncome to me and say: We are afraid he is going to fire Mueller. Will you \nstand with us to make sure Mueller can complete his investigation? And \nI did--2 years, $32 million, FBI agents, subpoenas, you name it. The \nverdict is in. What did we find? Nothing. I thought that would be it.\n  But it is never enough when it comes to President Trump. This sham \nprocess is the low point in the Senate for me. If you think you have \ndone the country a good service by legitimizing this impeachment \nprocess, what you have done is unleashed the partisan forces of Hell. \nThis is sour grapes.\n  They impeached the President of the United States in 78 days. You \ncannot get a parking ticket, if you contested it, in 78 days. They gave \nout souvenir pens when it was over.\n  If you can't see through that, your hatred of Donald Trump has \nblinded you to the obvious. This is not about protecting the country; \nthis is about destroying the President.\n  There are no rules when it comes to Donald Trump. Everybody in \nAmerica can confront the witnesses against them, except Donald Trump. \nEverybody in America can call witnesses on their behalf, except \nPresident Trump. Everybody in America can introduce evidence, except \nfor President Trump. He is not above the law, but you put him below the \nlaw. In the process of impeaching this President, you have made it \nalmost impossible for future Presidents to do their job.\n  In 78 days, you took due process, as we have come to know it in \nAmerica, and threw it in the garbage can. This is the first impeachment \nin the history of the country driven by politicians.\n  The Nixon impeachment had outside counsel, Watergate prosecutors. The \nClinton impeachment had Ken Starr, who looked at President Clinton for \nyears before he brought it to Congress. The Mueller investigation went \non for 2 years. I trusted Bob Mueller. And when he rendered his \nverdict, it broke your heart. And you can't let it go.\n  The only way this is going to end permanently is for the President to \nget reelected. And he will.\n  So as to abuse of Congress, it is a wholesale assault on the \nPresidency; it is abandoning every sense of fairness that every \nAmerican has come to expect in their own lives; it is driven by blind \npartisanship and hatred of the man himself. And they wanted to do it in \n78 days. Why? Because they wanted to impeach him before the election. I \nam not making this up. They said that.\n  The reason the President never was allowed to go to court and \nchallenge the subpoenas that were never issued is because the House \nmanagers understood it might take time. President Clinton and President \nNixon were allowed to go to article III court and contest the House's \naction. That was denied this President because it would get in the way \nof impeaching him before the election.\n  And you send this crap over here, and you are OK with it, my \nDemocratic colleagues. You are OK with the idea that the President was \ndenied his day in court, and you were going to rule on executive \nprivilege as a political body. You are willing to deal out the article \nIII court because you hate Trump that much.\n  What you have done is you have weakened the institution of the \nPresidency. Be careful what you wish for because it is going to come \nback your way.\n  Abuse of Congress should be entitled ``abuse of power by the \nCongress.'' If you think Adam Schiff is trying to get to the truth, I \nhave a bridge I want to sell you. These people hate Trump's guts. They \nrammed it through the House in a way you couldn't get a parking ticket, \nand they achieved their goal of impeaching him before the election.\n  The Senate is going to achieve its goal of acquitting him in \nFebruary. The American people are going to get to decide in November \nwhom they want to be their President.\n  Acquittal will happen in about 2 hours; exoneration comes when \nPresident Trump gets reelected because the people of the United States \nare fed up with this crap. But the damage you have done will be long-\nlasting.\n  Abuse of power. You are impeaching the President of the United States \nfor suspending foreign aid for a short period of time that they \neventually received ahead of schedule to leverage an investigation that \nnever happened. You are going to remove the President of the United \nStates for suspending foreign aid to leverage an investigation of a \npolitical opponent that never occurred. The Ukrainians did not know of \nthe suspension until September. They didn't feel any pressure. If you \nare OK with Joe Biden and Hunter Biden doing what they did, it says \nmore about you than it does anything else. The point of the abuse of \npower article is that you made it almost impossible now for any \nPresident to pick up the phone, if all of us can assume the worst and \nimpeach somebody based on this objective standard. He was talking about \ncorruption in the Ukraine with a past President.\n\n  And the Bidens' conduct in the Ukraine undercut our ability to \neffectively deal with corruption by allowing his son to receive $3 \nmillion from the most corrupt gas company in the Ukraine. Can you \nimagine how the Ukrainian Parliamentarian must have felt to be lectured \nby Joe Biden about ending sweetheart deals?\n  What you have done is impeached the President of the United States \nand willing to remove him because he suspended foreign aid for 40 days \nto leverage an investigation that never occurred.\n  And to my good friend Dick Durbin, Donald Trump has done more to help \nthe Ukrainian people than Barack Obama did in his entire 8 years. If \nyou are looking for somebody to help the Ukrainian people fight the \nRussians, how about giving them some weapons?\n  This is a sham. This is a farce. This is disgusting. This is an \naffront to President Trump as a person. It is a threat to the office. \nIt will end soon. There is going to be an overwhelming rejection of \nboth articles. We are going to pick up the pieces and try to go \nforward.\n  But I can say this without any hesitation: I worry about the future \nof the Presidency after what has happened here. Ladies and gentlemen, \nyou will come to regret this whole process.\n  And to those who have those pens, I hope you will understand history \nwill judge those pens as a souvenir of shame.\n  Mr. President, this is my second Presidential impeachment. My first \nwas as a House manager for the impeachment of President Clinton. I \nbelieve President Clinton corruptly interfered in a lawsuit filed \nagainst him by a private citizen alleging sexual assault and \nmisconduct. It was clear to me that President Clinton tampered with the \nevidence, suborned perjury, and tried to deny Paula Jones her day in \ncourt. I believed then and continue to believe now that these criminal \nacts against a private citizen by President Clinton were wholly \nunacceptable and should have cost him his job. However, at the end of \nthe Clinton impeachment, I accepted the conclusions of the Senate and \nsaid that a cloud had been removed from the Presidency, and it was time \nto move on.\n  During the Clinton impeachment, I voted against one Article of \nImpeachment that related to lying under oath regarding his sexual \nrelationship with\n\n\nMonica Lewinsky. While the conduct covered by that article was \ninappropriate, to have made such conduct impeachable would have done \ngrave damage to the Presidency by failing to recognize that, in the \nfuture, the office will be occupied by flawed human beings. It was \nobvious to me that President Clinton's lying under oath about his \nrelationship with Monica Lewinsky, while wrong, was not a high crime or \nmisdemeanor and that many people in similar circumstances would be \ninclined to lie to protect themselves and their families.\n  As to the impeachment of President Trump, I feel compelled to condemn \nthe impeachment process used in the House because I believe it was \ndevoid of basic, fundamental due process. The process used in the House \nfor this impeachment was unlike that used for Presidents Nixon or \nClinton. This impeachment was completed within 78 days and had a spirit \nof partisanship and revenge that if accepted by the Senate will lead to \nthe weaponization of impeachment against future presidents.\n  President Trump was entirely shut out of the evidence gathering stage \nin the House Intelligence Committee, denied the right to counsel, and \nthe right to cross-examine and call witnesses. Moreover, the great \nvolume of evidence gathered against President Trump by the House \nIntelligence Committee consists of inadmissible hearsay. The House \nJudiciary Committee impeachment hearings were, for lack of a better \nterm, a sham. And most importantly, the House managers admitted the \nreason that neither the House Intelligence Committee nor the House \nJudiciary Committee sought testimony in the House from President \nTrump's closest advisers, including former National Security Adviser \nJohn Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Acting Chief of Staff \nMick Mulvaney, is because it would have required the House to go to \ncourt, impeding their desire to impeach the President before the \nelection. It was a calculated decision to deal article III courts out \nof President Trump's impeachment inquiry due to a political timetable. \nThe Senate must send a clear message that this can never, ever happen \nagain.\n  As to the substance of the allegations against President Trump, the \nabuse of power charge as defined by the House is vague, does not allege \ncriminal misconduct, and requires the Senate to engage in a subjective \nanalysis of the President's motives and actions. The House managers \nargued to the Senate that the sole and exclusive purpose of freezing \naid to Ukraine was for the private, political benefit of President \nTrump. It is clear to me that there is ample evidence--much more than a \nmere scintilla--that the actions of Hunter Biden and Vice President \nBiden were inappropriate and undercut American foreign policy.\n  Moreover, there was evidence in the record that officials in Ukraine \nwere actively speaking against Candidate Trump and were pulling for \nformer Secretary of State Clinton. Based on the overwhelming amount of \nevidence of inappropriate behavior by the Bidens and statements by \nState Department officials about certain Ukrainians' beliefs that one \nAmerican candidate would be better than the other, I found it eminently \nreasonable for the President to be concerned about Ukraine corruption, \nelection interference, and the behavior of Vice President Biden and his \nson Hunter. It is hard to believe that Vice President Biden was an \neffective messenger for reform efforts in Ukraine while his son Hunter \nwas receiving $3 million from Burisma, one of Ukraine's most corrupt \ncompanies.\n  As Professor Dershowitz described, there are three buckets for \nexamining allegations of corrupt motive or action with regards to \nimpeachment. The first is where there is clearly only a public, \nnational benefit, as in the analogy of freezing aid to Israel unless it \nstops building new settlements. The second is the mixed motive category \nin which there is a public benefit--in this case, the public benefit of \nexposing the Bidens' conduct in the Ukrainian energy sector--and the \npossibility of a personal, political benefit as well. The third is \nwhere there is clearly a pure corrupt motive, as when there is a \npecuniary or financial benefit, an allegation that has not been made \nagainst President Trump.\n  It is obvious to me that, after the Mueller report, President Trump \nviewed the House impeachment inquiry as a gross double standard when it \ncomes to investigations. The House launched an investigation into his \nphone call with President Zelensky while at the same time the House \nshowed no interest in the actions of Vice President Biden and Hunter \nBiden. The President, in my view, was justified in asking the \nUkrainians to look into the circumstances surrounding the firing of \nUkrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who was investigating \nBurisma, and whether his termination benefited Hunter Biden and \nBurisma.\n  It is clear to me that the phone call focused on burden-sharing, \ncorruption, and election interference in an appropriate manner. The \nmost vexing question was how the President was supposed to deal with \nthese legitimate concerns. The House managers in one moment suggest \nthat President Trump could not have asked the Attorney General to \ninvestigate these concerns because that would be equivalent to \nPresident Trump asking for an investigation of a political rival. But \nin the next moment, the House managers declare that the proper way for \nPresident Trump to have dealt with those allegations would have been to \nask the Attorney General to investigate. They cannot have it both ways. \nI believe that it is fair to criticize President Trump's overreliance \non his private attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate alleged \ncorruption and conflicts of interest regarding the Bidens and Burisma. \nHowever, I do not find this remotely an impeachable offense, and it \nwould be beneficial for the country as a whole to find ways to deal \nwith such matters in the future.\n  Assuming the facts in the light most favorable to the House managers, \nthat for a period of time the aid was suspended by President Trump to \nget Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and election interference, I find \nboth articles fail as nonimpeachable offenses. I find this to be the \ncase even if we assume the New York Times article about Mr. Bolton is \naccurate. The Ukrainians received the military aid and did not open the \nrequested investigation.\n\n  The abuse of power Article of Impeachment is beyond vague and \nrequires a subjective analysis that no Senator should have to engage \nin. It also represents an existential threat to the Presidency. \nMoreover, the obstruction of Congress article is literally impeaching \nthe President because he chose to follow the advice of White House \ncounsel and the Department of Justice and he was willing to use \nconstitutional privileges in a manner consistent with every other \nPresident. This article must be soundly rejected, not only in this \ncase, but in the future. Whether one likes President Trump or not, he \nis the President with privileges attached to his office.\n  The House of Representatives, I believe, abused their authority by \nrushing this impeachment and putting the Senate in the position of \nhaving to play the role of an article III court. The long term effect \nof this practice would be to neuter the Presidency, making the office \nof the President only as strong as the House will allow.\n  The allegations contained in this impeachment are not what the \nFramers had in mind as high crimes or misdemeanors. The Framers, in my \nview, envisioned serious, criminal-like misconduct that would shake the \nfoundation of the American constitutional system. The Nixon impeachment \nhad broad bipartisan support once the facts became known. The Clinton \nimpeachment started with bipartisan support in the House and ended with \nbipartisan support in the Senate, even though it fell well short of the \ntwo-thirds vote requirement to remove the President. In the case of \nPresident Trump, this impeachment started as a partisan affair with \nbipartisan rejection of the Articles of Impeachment in the House and, \nif not rejected in the Senate, will lead to impeachment as almost an \ninevitability, as future Presidents will be subject to the partisan \nwhims of the House in any given moment.\n  My decision to vote not guilty on both Articles of Impeachment, I \nhope, will be seen as a rejection of what the House did and how they \ndid it. I firmly believe that article III courts have a role in the \nimpeachment process and that, to remove a President from office, the \nconduct has to be of a nature\n\n\nthat would shake the very foundation of our constitutional system. The \nimpeachment of President Trump was driven by a level of partisanship \nand ends justify the means behavior that the American people have \nrejected. The best way to end this matter is to allow the American \npeople to vote for or against President Trump in November, not to \nremove him from the ballot.\n  These Articles of Impeachment must be soundly rejected by the Senate \nbecause they represent an assault on the Presidency itself and the \nweaponization of impeachment as a political tool. They must fail for a \nvariety of reasons. First, the conduct being alleged by House managers \nis that there was a temporary suspension on military assistance to \nUkraine, which was eventually received ahead of schedule to leverage an \ninvestigation that never occurred. This is not the constitutional \nearthquake the Founders had in mind regarding bribery, treason, or \nother high crimes and misdemeanors. Second, the articles as drafted do \nnot allege any semblance of a crime and require the Senate to make a \nsubjective analysis of the President's motives. Third, the record is \nabundant with evidence that the President had legitimate concerns about \ncorruption, election interference emanating from the Ukraine, and that \nVice President Biden and his son undercut U.S. efforts to reform \ncorruption inside Ukraine.\n  The second article, alleging obstruction of Congress, is literally \npunishing the President for exercising the legal rights available to \nall Presidents as part of our constitutional structure. This article \nmust fail because the House chose their impeachment path based on a \npolitical timetable of impeaching the President before Christmas to set \nup an election year trial in the Senate. The Senate must reject the \ntheory offered by the House managers with regard to obstruction of \nCongress; to do otherwise would allow the House in the future to deal \narticle III courts out of the impeachment process and give the House \ncomplete control over the impeachment field in a way that denies \nfundamental fairness.\n  Because it took the House 78 days from start to finish to impeach the \nPresident of the United States and, during its fact-gathering process, \nthe House denied the President the right to counsel, to cross-examine \nwitnesses against him, and the ability to introduce evidence on his \nbehalf, the Senate must reject both Articles of Impeachment.\n  I am compelled to vote not guilty, to ensure impeachment will not \nbecome the new normal.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 63, "speaker_bioguide": "G000359", "itemno": 80}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "The PRESIDING OFFICER", "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.", "turn": 64, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 81}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "Mr. SCHUMER", "text": "  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the Articles of Impeachment before us \ncharged President Donald John Trump with offenses against the \nConstitution and the American people.\n  The first Article of Impeachment charges that President Trump abused \nthe Office of the Presidency by soliciting the interference of a \nforeign power, Ukraine, to benefit himself in the 2020 election. The \nPresident asked a foreign leader to ``do us a favor''--``us'' meaning \nhim--and investigate his political opponents.\n  In order to elicit these political investigations, President Trump \nwithheld a White House meeting and hundreds of millions of dollars in \nmilitary assistance from an ally at war with Russia. There is extensive \ndocumentation in the record proving this quid pro quo and the corrupt \nmotive behind it. The facts are not seriously in dispute. In fact, \nseveral Republican Senators admitted they believe the President \ncommitted this offense with varying degrees of ``inappropriate,'' \n``wrong,'' ``shameful.'' Almost all Republicans will argue, however, \nthat this reprehensible conduct does not rise to the level of an \nimpeachable offense.\n  The Founders could not have been clearer. William Davie, a delegate \nto the Constitutional Convention, deemed impeachment ``an essential \nsecurity,'' lest the President ``spare no efforts or means whatever to \nget himself reelected.''\n  James Madison offered a specific list of impeachable offenses during \na debate in Independence Hall:\n  A President ``might lose his capacity'' or embezzle public funds.\n  ``A despicable soul might even succumb to bribes while in office.''\n  Madison then arrived at what he believed was the worst conduct a \nPresident could engage in: the President could ``betray his trust to \nforeign powers,'' which would be ``fatal to the Republic.'' Those are \nMadison's words.\n  When I studied the Constitution and the Federalist Papers in high \nschool, admittedly, I was skeptical of George Washington's warning that \n``foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican \ngovernment.'' It seemed so far-fetched. Who would dare? But the \nforesight and wisdom of the Founders endure. Madison was right. \nWashington was right.\n  There is no greater subversion of our democracy than for powers \noutside of our borders to determine elections within them. If Americans \nbelieve that they don't determine their Senator, their Governor, their \nPresident, but, rather, some foreign potentate does, that is the \nbeginning of the end of democracy.\n  For a foreign country to attempt such a thing on its own is \ncontemptible. For an American President to deliberately solicit such a \nthing--to blackmail a foreign country into helping him win an \nelection--is unforgivable.\n  Does this rise to the level of an impeachable offense? Of course it \ndoes. Of course it does. The term ``high crimes'' derives from English \nlaw. ``Crimes'' were committed between subjects of the monarchy. ``High \ncrimes'' were committed against the Crown itself. The Framers did not \ndesign a monarchy; they designed a democracy, a nation where the people \nwere King. High crimes are those committed against the entire people of \nthe United States.\n  The President sought to cheat the people out of a free and fair \nelection. How could such an offense not be deemed a high crime--a crime \nagainst the people? As one constitutional scholar in the House \nJudiciary hearings testified: ``If this is not impeachable, nothing \nis.'' I agree.\n  I judge that President Trump is guilty of the first Article of \nImpeachment.\n  The second Article of Impeachment is equally straightforward. Once \nthe President realized he got caught, he tried to cover it up. The \nPresident asserted blanket immunity. He categorically defied \ncongressional subpoenas, ordered his aides not to testify, and withheld \nthe production of relevant documents.\n  Even President Nixon, author of the most infamous Presidential \ncoverup in history, permitted his aides to testify in Congress in the \nWatergate investigation. The idea that the Trump administration was \nproperly invoking the various rights and privileges of the Presidency \nis nonsense. At each stage of the House inquiry, the administration \nconjured up a different bad-faith justification for evading \naccountability. There is no circumstance under which the administration \nwould have complied.\n\n  When I asked the President's counsel twice to name one document or \none witness the President provided to Congress, they could not answer. \nIt cannot be that the President, by dint of legal shamelessness, can \nescape scrutiny entirely.\n  Once again, the facts are not in dispute, but some have sought to \nportray the second Article of Impeachment as somehow less important \nthan the first. It is not. The second Article of Impeachment is \nnecessary if Congress is to ever hold a President accountable--again, \nDemocratic or Republican. The consequences of sanctioning such \ncategorical obstruction of Congress will be far-reaching, and they will \nbe irreparable.\n  I judge that President Trump is guilty of the second Article of \nImpeachment.\n  The Senate should convict President Trump, remove him from the \nPresidency, and disqualify him from holding future office. The guilt of \nthe President on these charges is so obvious that here, again, several \nRepublican Senators admit that the House has proved its case.\n  So instead of maintaining the President's innocence, the President's \ncounsel ultimately told the Senate that even if the President did what \nhe was accused of, it is not impeachable. This has taken the form of an \nescalating series of Dershowitzian arguments, including ``Abuse of \npower is not an impeachable offense''; ``The President\n\n\ncan't be impeached for noncriminal conduct, but he also can't be \nindicted for criminal conduct''; ``If a President believes his own \nreelection is essential to the Nation, then a quid pro quo is not \ncorrupt.'' These are the excuses of a child caught in a lie.\n  Each explanation is more outlandish and desperate than the last. It \nwould be laughable if not for the fact that the cumulative effect of \nthese arguments would render not just this President but all Presidents \nimmune from impeachment and therefore above the law.\n  Several Members of this Chamber said that even if the President is \nguilty and even if it is impeachable, the Senate still shouldn't \nconvict the President because there is an election coming up--as if the \nFramers forgot about elections when they wrote the impeachment clause. \nIf the Founders believed that even when a President is guilty of an \nimpeachable offense, the next election should decide his fate, they \nnever would have included an impeachment clause in the Constitution. \nThat much is obvious.\n  Alone, each of the defenses advanced by the President's counsel comes \nclose to being preposterous. Together, they are as dangerous to the \nRepublic as this President--a fig leaf so large as to excuse any \nPresidential misconduct. Unable to defend the President, arguments were \nfound to make him a King.\n  Let future generations know that only a fraction of the Senate \nswallowed these fantasies. The rest of us condemn them to the ash heap \nof history and the derision of first-year law students everywhere.\n  We are only the third Senate in history to sit as a Court of \nImpeachment for the President. The task we were given was not easy, but \nthe Framers gave the Senate this responsibility because they could not \nimagine any other body capable of it. They considered others, but they \nentrusted it to us, and the Senate failed. The Republican caucus \ntrained its outrage not on the conduct of the President but on the \nimpeachment process in the House, deriding--falsely--an alleged lack of \nfairness and thoroughness.\n  The conjured outrage was so blinding that the Republican majority \nended up guilty of the very sins it falsely accused the House of \ncommitting. It conducted the least fair, least thorough, most rushed \nimpeachment trial in the history of this country.\n  A simple majority of Senators denied the Senate's right to examine \nrelevant evidence, to call witnesses, to review documents, and to \nproperly try the impeachment of the President, making this the first \nimpeachment trial in history that heard from no witnesses. A simple \nmajority of Senators, in deference to and most likely in fear of the \nPresident of their party, perpetrated a great miscarriage of justice in \nthe trial of President Trump. As a result, the verdict of this kangaroo \ncourt will be meaningless.\n  By refusing the facts, by refusing witnesses and documents, the \nRepublican majority has placed a giant asterisk--the asterisk of a sham \ntrial--next to the acquittal of President Trump, written in permanent \nink. Acquittal and an unfair trial with this giant asterisk--the \nasterisk of a sham trial--are worth nothing at all to President Trump \nor to anybody else.\n  No doubt, the President will boast he received total exoneration, but \nwe know better. We know this wasn't a trial by any stretch of the \ndefinition. And the American people know it, too.\n  We have heard a lot about the Framers over the past several weeks, \nabout the impeachment clause they forged, the separation of powers they \nwrought, the conduct they most feared in our chief magistrate. But \nthere is something the Founders considered even more fundamental to our \nRepublic: truth. The Founders had seen and studied societies governed \nby the iron fist of tyrants and the divine right of Kings, but none by \nargument, rational thinking, facts, and debate.\n  Hamilton said the American people would determine ``whether societies \nof men are really capable or not of establishing good government from \nreflection and choice, or . . . forever destined to depend on accident \nand force.'' And what an astonishing thing the Founders did. They \nplaced a bet with long odds. They believed that ``reflection and \nchoice'' would make us capable of self-government; that we wouldn't \nagree on everything, but at least we could agree on a common baseline \nof fact and of truth. They wrote a Constitution with the remarkable \nidea that even the most powerful person in our country was not above \nthe law and could be put on trial. A trial--a place where you seek \ntruth. The faith our Founders placed in us makes the failure of this \nSenate even more damning.\n\n  Our Nation was founded on the idea of truth, but there was no truth \nhere. The Republican majority couldn't let truth into this trial. The \nRepublican majority refused to get the evidence because they were \nafraid of what it might show.\n  Our Nation was founded on the idea of truth, but in order to \ncountenance this President, you have to ignore the truth. The \nRepublicans walk through the halls with their heads down. They didn't \nsee the tweet. They can't respond to everything he says. They hope he \nlearned his lesson this time. Yes, maybe, this time, he learned his \nlesson.\n  Our Nation was founded on truth, but in order to excuse this \nPresident, you have to willfully ignore the truth and indulge in the \nPresident's conspiracy theories: Millions of people voted illegally. \nThe deep state is out to get him. Ukraine interfered in our elections. \nYou must attempt to normalize his behavior. Obama did it, too, they \nfalsely claim. The Democrats are just as bad.\n  Our Nation was founded on the idea of truth, but this President is \nsuch a menace--so contemptuous of every virtue, so dishonorable, so \ndishonest--that you must ignore--indeed, sacrifice--the truth to \nmaintain his favor.\n  The trial of this President--its failure--reflects the central \nchallenge of this Presidency and, maybe, the central challenge of this \ntime in our democracy. You cannot be on the side of this President and \nbe on the side of truth, and if we are to survive as a nation, we must \nchoose truth because, if the truth doesn't matter, if the news you \ndon't like is fake, if cheating in an election is acceptable, if \neveryone is as wicked as the wickedest among us, then hope for the \nfuture is lost.\n  The eyes of the Nation are upon this Senate, and what they see will \nstrike doubt in the heart of even the most ardent patriot.\n  The House managers established that the President abused the great \npower of his office to try to cheat in an election, and the Senate \nmajority is poised to look the other way.\n  So I direct my final message not to the House managers, not even to \nmy fellow Senators, but to the American people. My message is simple: \nDon't lose hope. There is justice in this world and truth and right. I \nbelieve that. I wouldn't be in this government if I didn't. Somehow, in \nways we can't predict, with God's mysterious hand guiding us, truth and \nright will prevail.\n  There have been dark periods in our history, but we always overcome. \nThe Senate's opening prayer yesterday was Amos 5:24: Let justice roll \ndown like water, righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.\n  The long arc of the moral universe, my fellow Americans, does bend \ntoward justice. America does change for the better but not on its own. \nIt took millions of Americans hundreds of years to make this country \nwhat it is today--Americans of every age and color and creed who \nmarched and protested, who stood up and sat in; Americans who died \nwhile defending this democracy, this beautiful democracy, in its \ndarkest hours.\n  On Memorial Day in 1884, Oliver Wendell Holmes told his war-weary \naudience: ``[W]hether [one] accepts from Fortune her spade, and will \nlook downward and dig, or from Aspiration her axe and cord, and will \nscale the ice, the one and only success which it is [yours] to command \nis to bring to [your] work a mighty heart.''\n  I have confidence that Americans of a different generation--our \ngeneration--will bring to our work a mighty heart to fight for what is \nright, to fight for the truth, and never, never lose faith.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 65, "speaker_bioguide": "S000148", "itemno": 82}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "The PRESIDING OFFICER", "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the U.S. Senate was made for moments \nlike this. The Framers predicted that factional fever might dominate \nHouse majorities from time to time. They knew the country would need a \nfirewall\n\n\nto keep partisan flames from scorching our Republic. So they created \nthe Senate--out of ``necessity,'' James Madison wrote, ``of some stable \ninstitution in the government.''\n  Today, we will fulfill this founding purpose. We will reject this \nincoherent case that comes nowhere near--nowhere near--justifying the \nfirst Presidential removal in history. This partisan impeachment will \nend today, but I fear the threat to our institutions may not because \nthis episode is one symptom of something much deeper.\n  In the last 3 years, the opposition to this President has come to \nrevolve around a truly dangerous concept. Leaders in the opposite party \nincreasingly argue that, if our institutions don't produce the outcomes \nthey like, our institutions themselves must be broken. One side has \ndecided that defeat simply means the whole system is broken, that we \nmust literally tear up the rules and write new ones.\n  Normally, when a party loses an election, it accepts defeat. It \nreflects and retools--but not this time.\n  Within months, Secretary Clinton was suggesting her defeat was \ninvalid. She called our President ``illegitimate.'' A former President \nfalsely claimed: ``[President] Trump didn't actually win.'' ``He lost \nthe election,'' a former President said. Members of Congress have used \nsimilar rhetoric--a disinformation campaign, weakening confidence in \nour democracy.\n  The very real issue of foreign election interference was abused to \nfuel conspiracy theories. For years, prominent voices said there had \nbeen a secret conspiracy between the President's campaign and a foreign \ngovernment, but when the Mueller investigation and the Senate \nIntelligence Committee debunked that, the delegitimizing endeavor \ndidn't stop. It didn't stop.\n  Remember what Chairman Schiff said here on the floor? He suggested \nthat if the American people reelect President Trump in November that \nthe election will be presumptively invalid as well. That was Chairman \nSchiff, on this floor, saying, if the American people reelect President \nTrump this November, the election will be presumptively invalid as \nwell.\n  So they still don't accept the American voters' last decision, and \nnow they are preparing to reject the voters' next decision if they \ndon't like the outcome--not only the last decision but the next \ndecision. Heads, we win. Tails, you cheated. And who can trust our \ndemocracy anyway, they say?\n  This kind of talk creates more fear and division than our foreign \nadversaries could achieve in their wildest dreams. As Dr. Hill \ntestified, our adversaries seek to ``divide us against each other, \ndegrade our institutions, and destroy the faith of the American people \nin our democracy.'' As she noted, if Americans become ``consumed by \npartisan rancor,'' we can easily do that work for them.\n  The architects of this impeachment claimed they were defending norms \nand traditions. In reality, it was an assault on both.\n  First, the House attacked its own precedents on fairness and due \nprocess and by rushing to use the impeachment power as a political \nweapon of first resort. Then their articles attacked the Office of the \nPresidency. Then they attacked the Senate and called us \n``treacherous.'' Then the far left tried to impugn the Chief Justice \nfor remaining neutral during the trial.\n  Now, for the final act, the Speaker of the House is trying to steal \nthe Senate's sole power to render a verdict. The Speaker says she will \njust refuse to accept this acquittal. The Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives says she refuses to accept this acquittal--whatever \nthat means. Perhaps she will tear up the verdict like she tore up the \nState of the Union Address.\n  So I would ask my distinguished colleagues across the aisle: Is this \nreally--really--where you want to go? The President isn't the \nPresident? An acquittal isn't an acquittal? Attack institutions until \nthey get their way? Even my colleagues who may not agree with this \nPresident must see the insanity of this logic. It is like saying you \nare so worried about a bull in a china shop that you want to bulldoze \nthe china shop to chase it out.\n  Here is the most troubling part. There is no sign this attack on our \ninstitutions will end here. In recent months, Democratic Presidential \ncandidates and Senate leaders have toyed with killing the filibuster so \nthat the Senate could approve radical changes with less deliberation \nand less persuasion.\n  Several of our colleagues sent an extraordinary brief to the Supreme \nCourt, threatening political retribution if the Justices did not decide \na case the way they wanted.\n  We have seen proposals to turn the FEC--the regulator of elections \nand political speech--into a partisan body for the first time ever.\n  All of these things signal a toxic temptation to stop debating policy \nwithin our great American governing traditions and, instead, declare \nwar on the traditions themselves--a war on the traditions themselves.\n  So, colleagues, with whatever policy differences we may have, we \nshould all agree this is precisely the kind of recklessness the Senate \nwas created to stop. The response to losing one election cannot be to \nattack the Office of the Presidency. The response to losing several \nelections cannot be to threaten the electoral college. The response to \nlosing a court case cannot be to threaten the judiciary. The response \nto losing a vote cannot be to threaten the Senate.\n  We simply cannot let factional fever break our institutions. It must \nwork the other way, as Madison and Hamilton intended. The institutions \nmust break the fever rather than the other way around.\n  The Framers built the Senate to keep temporary rage from doing \npermanent damage to our Republic.\n  The Framers built the Senate to keep temporary rage from doing \npermanent damage to our Republic. That is what we will do when we end \nthis precedent-breaking impeachment.\n  I hope we will look back on this vote and say this was the day the \nfever began to break.\n  I hope we will not say this was just the beginning.", "turn": 67, "speaker_bioguide": "M000355", "itemno": 84}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "Mr. GRASSLEY", "text": "  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as Senators, we cast a lot of votes \nthroughout our tenure in this body. I have cast over 13,200 of them. \nEach vote is important. A vote to convict or acquit the President of \nthe United States on charges of impeachment is one of the most \nimportant votes a Senator could ever cast. Until this week, such a vote \nhas only taken place twice since the founding of our Republic.\n  The President has been accused of committing ``high Crimes and \nMisdemeanors'' for requesting that a foreign leader launch an anti-\ncorruption investigation into his potential political opponent and \nobstructing Congress's subsequent inquiry into his actions. For such \nconduct, the House of Representatives asks this body to remove the \nPresident from office and prohibit him from ever again serving in a \nposition of public trust. As both a judge and juror, this Senator asks \nfirst whether the conduct alleged rises to the level of an offense that \nunquestionably demands removal. If it does, I ask whether the House has \nproven beyond a reasonable doubt that the conduct actually occurred. \nThe House's case clearly fails on the first of those questions. \nAccordingly, I will vote not guilty on both articles.\n  The President's request, taken at face value, is not impeachable \nconduct. A President is not prohibited by law or any other restriction \nfrom engaging the assistance of a foreign ally in an anti-corruption \ninvestigation. The House attempts to cure this defect by suggesting \nthat the President's subjective motive--political advantage--is enough \nto turn an otherwise unimpeachable act into one that demands permanent \nremoval from office. I will not lend my vote in support of such an \nunnecessary and irreversible break from the Constitution's clear \nstandard for impeachment.\n  The Senate is an institution of precedent. We are informed and often \nguided, especially in times like this, by history and the actions of \nour predecessors. While we look to history, however, we must be mindful \nof the reality that our choices make history, for better or for worse. \nWhat we say and do here necessarily becomes part of the roadmap for \nfuture Presidential impeachments and their consideration by this body. \nThese days, that reality can be difficult to keep front and center. \nPartisan fervor to convict or acquit a President of the United States \nwho has been impeached can lead to cut corners, overheated rhetoric, \nand rushed\n\n\nresults. We are each bound by the special oath we take while sitting as \na Court of Impeachment to ``do impartial justice according to the \nConstitution and laws.'' But as President pro tempore, I recognize we \nmust also do justice to the Senate as an institution and to the \nRepublic that it serves.\n  This trial began with a full and fair opportunity to debate and amend \nthe rules that would guide our process. The Senate considered and voted \non 11 separate amendments to the resolution, over the span of nearly 13 \nhours. Consistent with precedent, the Senate adopted a resolution to \nallow the same length of time for opening arguments and questions as \nwas agreed to unanimously in 1999 during the Clinton impeachment trial. \nConsistent with precedent, the Senate agreed to table the issue of \nwitnesses and additional evidence until after the conclusion of \nquestions from Members. Consistent with precedent, the Senate engaged \nin a robust and open debate on the necessity of calling witnesses and \npursuing additional evidence. We heard nearly 24 hours of presentation \nfrom the House managers, nearly 12 hours of presentation from the \nPresident's counsel, and we engaged in 16 hours of questioning to both \nsides.\n  Up to today, the Senate has sat as a Court of Impeachment for a \ncombined total of over 70 hours. The Senate did not and does not cut \ncorners, nor can the final vote be credibly called a rushed result or \nanything less than the product of a fair and judicious process. Future \ngenerations, if faced with the toxic turmoil of impeachment, will be \nbetter served by the precedent we followed and the example we set in \nthis Chamber. I cannot in good conscience say the same of the articles \nbefore us today.\n  I have said since the beginning of this unfortunate episode that the \nHouse's articles don't, on their face, appear to allege anything \nsatisfying the Constitution's clear requirement of ``Treason, Bribery, \nor other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' Yet I took my role as a juror \nseriously. I committed to hear the evidence in the record and to \nreflect on the arguments made. After 9 days of presentation and \nquestions and after fully considering the record as presented to the \nSenate, I am convinced that what the House is asking us to do is not \nonly constitutionally flawed but dangerously unprecedented.\n  The House's first article, impeaching the President for ``abuse of \npower,'' rests on objectively legal conduct. Until Congress legislates \notherwise, a President is well within his or her legal and \nconstitutional authority, as the head of state, to request that a \nforeign leader assist with an anti-corruption investigation falling \noutside of the jurisdiction of our domestic law enforcement \nauthorities. Short of political blowback, there is also nothing in the \nlaw that prohibits a President from conditioning his or her official \nacts upon the agreement by the foreign leader to carry out such an \ninvestigation.\n  In an attempt to cure this fundamental defect in its charge, the \nHouse's ``abuse of power'' article sets out an impermissibly flexible \nand vague standard to justify removing the Chief Executive from office. \nAs the House's trial brief and presentation demonstrated, its theory of \nthe case rests entirely on the President's subjective motive for \ncarrying out objectively permissible conduct. For two reasons, this \ncannot be sustained.\n  First, the House would seemingly have the Senate believe that motive \nby itself is sufficient to prove the illegality of an action. House \nmanagers repeatedly described the President's ``corrupt motive'' as \ngrounds for removal from office. But this flips basic concepts in our \njustice system upside down and represents an unprecedented expansion of \nthe scope of the impeachment authority. With limited exception, motive \nis offered in court to show that the defendant on trial is the one who \nmost likely committed the illegal act that has been charged. Jealously \nmight compel one neighbor to steal something from the other. But a \ncourt doesn't convict the defendant for a crime of jealousy. Second, \nlet's assume, however, that motive could be grounds for impeachment and \nremoval. The House offers no limiting principle or clear standard \nwhatsoever of what motives are permissible. Under such an amorphous \nstandard, future Houses would be empowered to impeach Presidents for \ntaking lawful action for what the House considers to be the wrong \nreasons.\n  The House also gives no aid to this institution or to our successors \non whether impeachment should rest on proving a single, ``corrupt'' \nmotive or whether mixed motive suffices under their theory for removing \na President from office. In its trial brief presented to the Senate, \nthe House asserts that there is ``no credible alternative explanation'' \nfor the President's alleged conduct. This formulation, in the House's \nown brief, necessarily implies that the presence of a credible \nalternative explanation for the President's conduct would defeat the \n``abuse of power'' theory. But once the Senate heard the President's \ncounsel's presentation, the House changed its tune. Even a credible \nalternative explanation--or multiple benign motives--shouldn't stop \nthis body from removing the President, so long as one ``corrupt'' \nmotive is in the mix. This apparent shift in trial strategy seems less \nindicative of a cohesive theory and more reflective of an ``impeach-by-\nany-means-necessary'' mindset. But reshaping their own standard mid-\ntrial only served to undercut their initial arguments.\n  Simply asserting at least 63 times, as the House managers did, during \nthe trial that their evidence was ``overwhelming'' and that the \nPresident's guilt was proven does not make the underlying allegations \naccurate or prove an impeachable offense. Even in the midst of \nquestions and answers, after opening arguments had concluded, the House \nmanagers started repeating the terms ``bribery'' and ``extortion'' on \nthe floor of the Senate, while neither appears anywhere in the House's \narticles. These are serious, statutory crimes that have specific \nelements of proof; they shouldn't be casually used as window dressing \nto inflame the jury. And the House's attempts to shoehorn those charges \ninto their articles is itself a due process violation.\n  It is not the Senate's job to read into the House's articles what the \nHouse failed or didn't see fit to incorporate itself. No more so is it \nthe job of a judge to read nonexistent provisions into legislation that \nCongress passes and the President signs. Articles of Impeachment should \nnot be moving targets.\n  The Senate, accordingly, doesn't need to resolve today the question \nof whether a criminal violation is necessary for a President's conduct \nto be impeachable. The text of the Constitution and the Framers' clear \nintent to limit the scope of the impeachment power counsels in favor of \nsuch a brightline rule. And until this episode, no President has been \nimpeached on charges that didn't include a violation of established \nlaw. Indeed, the only Presidential impeachments considered by this body \nincluded alleged violations of laws, and both resulted in acquittals. \nBut the stated ambiguities surrounding the House's ``abuse of power'' \ntheory, acknowledged even by the House managers, give this Senator \nreason enough to vote not guilty. If we are to lower the bar of \nimpeachment, we better be clear on where the bar is being set.\n  The President himself, however, should not conclude from my vote that \nI think his conduct was above reproach. He alone knows what his motives \nwere. The President has a duty to the American people to root out \ncorruption no matter who is implicated. And running for office does not \nmake one immune from scrutiny. But the President's request was poorly \ntimed and poorly executed, and he should have taken better care to \navoid even the mere appearance of impropriety. Had he done so, this \nimpeachment saga might have been avoided altogether. It is clear that \nmany of the President's opponents had plans to impeach him from the day \nhe took office. But the President didn't have to give them this \npretense.\n  The House's second article, impeaching the President for \n``obstruction of Congress,'' is equally unprecedented as grounds for \nremoval from office and patently frivolous. It purports that, if the \nPresident claims constitutional privileges against Congress, \n``threatens'' to litigate, or otherwise fails to immediately give up \nthe goods, he or she must be removed from office.\n  I know a thing or two about obstruction by the executive branch under\n\n\nboth Democrat and Republican administrations. Congressional oversight--\nrooting out waste, fraud, and abuse--is central to my role as a Senator \nrepresenting Iowa taxpayers and has been for 40 years. If there is \nanything as sure as death and taxes, it is Federal agencies resisting \nCongress' efforts to look behind the curtain. In the face of \nobstruction, I don't retreat. I go to work. I use the tools the \nConstitution provides to this institution. I withhold consent on \nnominees until I get an honest answer to an oversight request. I work \nwith my colleagues to exercise Congress's power of the purse. And when \nnecessary, I take the administration to court. That is the very core of \nchecks and balances. For years, I fought the Obama administration to \nobtain documents related to Operation Fast and Furious. I spent years \nseeking answers and records from the Obama administration during my \ninvestigation into Secretary Clinton's mishandling of highly classified \ninformation.\n  Under the House's ``obstruction of Congress'' standard, should \nPresident Obama have been impeached for his failure to waive privileges \nduring the course of my and other committees' oversight investigations? \nWe fought President Obama on this for 3 years in the courts, and we \nstill didn't end up with all we asked for. We never heard a peep from \nthe Democrats then. So the hypocrisy here by the House Democrats is on \nfull display.\n  When I face unprecedented obstruction, I don't agitate to impeach. \nRather, my office aggressively negotiates, in good faith, with the \nexecutive branch. We discuss the scope of questions and document \nrequests. We discuss the intent of the inquiry to provide context for \nthe requested documents. We build an airtight case and demand \ncooperation. Negotiations are difficult. They take time.\n  In the case before us, the House issued a series of requests and \nsubpoenas to individuals within the White House and throughout the \nadministration. But it did so rather early in its inquiry. The House \nlearned of the whistleblower complaint in September, issued subpoenas \nfor records in October, and impeached the President by December, 4 \nmonths from opening the inquiry to impeachment for ``obstruction.'' As \none who can speak from experience, that is unreasonable and doesn't \nallow an investigation to appropriately and reasonably run its course. \nThat timeline makes clear to me that the House majority really had one \ngoal in mind: to impeach the President at all costs, no matter what the \nfacts and the law might say. Most importantly, the House failed to \nexhaust all legal remedies to enforce its requests and subpoenas. When \nchallenged to stand up for the legality of its requests in court, the \ninvestigating committee simply retreated. Yet, now, the House accuses \nthe Senate of aiding and abetting a coverup, if we don't finish their \njob for them. The evidence is ``overwhelming,'' yet the Senate must \nentertain more witnesses and gather more records that the House chose \nto forgo.\n  The House's failure to proceed with their investigation in an \norderly, reasonable, good-faith manner has created fundamental flaws in \nits own case. They skipped basic steps. It is not the job of the Senate \nto fix the fundamental flaws that directly result from the House's \nfailure to do its job. The House may cower to defend its own authority, \nbut it will not extort and demean this body into cleaning up a mess of \nthe House's own making.\n  For the myriad ways in which the House failed to exercise the \nfundamentals of oversight, for the terrible new precedent the House \nwants us to endorse, and for the risk of future generations taking it \nup as the standard, I will vote not guilty on the obstruction article.\n  Now, there has been much discussion and debate about the \nwhistleblower whose complaint framed the House's inquiry in this case. \nI have worked for and with whistleblowers for more than 30 years. They \nshed light on waste, fraud, and abuse that ought to be fixed and that \nthe public ought to know about, all frequently at great personal cost. \nWhistleblowers are patriots, and they are heroes. I believed that in \nthe 1980s. I believe it today. I have sponsored, cosponsored, and \notherwise strongly supported numerous laws designed to strengthen \nwhistleblowers protections. I have reminded agencies of the \nwhistleblowers' rights to speak with us and of their protection under \nthe law for doing so. And this is how it works. Of course, it is much \nbetter to have firsthand information because it is more reliable. \nHowever, whether it is firsthand information or secondhand, it is \npossible to conduct a thorough investigation of a whistleblower's \nclaims and respect his or her request for confidentiality.\n  As I said in October of last year, attempts by anyone in government \nor the media to ``out'' a whistleblower just to sell an article or \nscore a political point is not helpful. It undermines the spirit and \npurpose of the whistleblower protection laws. I remember very well the \nrabid, public lashing experienced by the brave whistleblowers who came \nto me about the Obama administration's Operation Fast and Furious. \nPresident Obama's Justice Department worked overtime to discredit them \nand tarnish their good names in the press, all to protect an operation \nthat it tried to keep hidden from Congress and the American people, and \nthat resulted in the death of an American Border Patrol agent. That was \nnot the treatment those whistleblowers deserved. It is not the \ntreatment any whistleblower deserves, who comes forward in good faith, \nto report what he or she truly believes is waste, fraud, or abuse.\n  But whistleblower claims require careful evaluation and follow up, \nparticularly because their initial claim frames your inquiry and forms \nthe basis for further fact finding. The questions you ask and the \ndocuments and witnesses you seek all start there. Any investigator \nworth their salt will tell you that part of the investigative process \ninvolving a whistleblower, or indeed any witness, requires the \ninvestigator to evaluate that individual's claim and credibility. It is \nstandard procedure. So we talk to the whistleblowers, we meet with them \nwhen possible, we look at their documents. We keep them confidential \nfrom potential retaliators, but not from the folks who need to speak \nwith them to do their jobs. When whistleblowers bring to us significant \ncases of bipartisan interest, where we have initially evaluated their \nclaim and credibility and determined that the claim merits additional \nfollow up, we also frequently work closely with the other side to look \ninto those claims.\n  We have done many bipartisan investigations of whistleblowers' claims \nover the years and hopefully will continue to do so. We trust the other \nside to respect the whistleblower's confidence as well and treat the \ninvestigation seriously. We have also worked with many witnesses in \ninvestigations who want to maintain low profiles and who request \nadditional security measures to come and speak with us. We are flexible \non location. We have the Capitol Police. We have SCIFs. We have \ninterviewed witnesses in both classified and unclassified settings. We \nare willing to work with those witnesses to make them comfortable and \nto ensure they are in a setting that allows them to share sensitive \ninformation with us.\n  I know the House committees, particularly the oversight committees, \nhave all taken that course themselves. They routinely work with \nwhistleblowers too. Both sides understand how to talk to whistleblowers \nand how to respect their role and confidentiality. So why no efforts \nwere taken in this case to go through these very basic, bipartisan \nsteps is baffling. I do not under any circumstances support reprisal or \nefforts to throw stones without facts. But neither do I support efforts \nto skirt basic fundamental investigative procedures to try and learn \nthose facts. I fear that, to achieve its desired ends, the House \nweaponized and politicized whistleblowers and whistleblower reporting \nfor purely partisan purposes. I hope that the damage done from all \nsides to these decades-long efforts will be short lived.\n  Finally, throughout my time on the Judiciary Committee, including as \nchairman, I have made it a priority to hold judicial nominees to a \nstandard of restraint and fidelity to the law. As judges in the Court \nof Impeachment, we too should be mindful of those factors which counsel \nrestraint in this matter.\n  To start, these articles came to the Senate as the product of a \nflawed, unprecedented and partisan process. For\n\n\n71 of the 78 days of the House's expedited impeachment inquiry, the \nPresident was not permitted to take part or have agency counsel \npresent. Many of the rights traditionally afforded to the minority \nparty in impeachment proceedings were altered or withheld. And an \nauthorizing vote by the full House didn't occur until 4 weeks after \nhearings had already begun. When the articles themselves were put to a \nvote by the full House, just in time for Christmas, the only \nbipartisanship we saw was in opposition. Moreover, the Iowa caucuses \nhave already occurred. The 2020 Presidential election is well underway. \nYet we are being asked to remove the incumbent from the ballot, based \non Articles of Impeachment supported by only one party in Congress. \nTaken together, the Senate should take no part in endorsing the \ndangerous new precedent this would set for future impeachments.\n  With more than 28,000 pages of evidence, 17 witnesses, and over 70 \nhours of open, transparent consideration by the Senate, I believe the \nAmerican people are more than adequately prepared to decide for \nthemselves the fate of this President in November. This decision \nbelongs to them.\n  When the Chief Justice spoke up at the start of this trial to defuse \nsome rising emotions, he challenged both sides addressing the Chamber \nto ``remember where they are.'' We, too, should remember where we are. \nThe U.S. Senate has ably served the American people through trying \ntimes. These are trying times. And when this trial adjourns, the cloud \nof impeachment may not so quickly depart. But if there is any \ninstitution best equipped to help bridge the divide and once again \nachieve our common goals, it is this one.\n  Let's get back to work for the People.", "turn": 68, "speaker_bioguide": "G000386", "itemno": 85}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "Mr. LEAHY", "text": "  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the question before us is incredibly \nserious, but it is also more than a little absurd. We are sitting as a \ncourt, exercising the sole power to try impeachments, entrusted to us \nby the Framers. The President of the United States has been charged \nwith high crimes--a constitutional charge of abuse of power that \nincludes in its text each of the elements of criminal bribery. The \nPresident's lawyers have complained all week about the absence of sworn \ntestimony from officials with first-hand knowledge of the President's \nactions and intent. They claim not to know when the President froze the \naid. They falsely claim there is no evidence the President withheld the \naid in exchange for his political errand--announcing an investigation \ninto his political rival. And yet whenever the President's counsels \nhave pled ignorance or claimed a lack of evidence, they ask not that we \npursue the truth; they ask instead that we look away.\n  The Senate simply cannot look away. In the 220 years this body has \nserved as a constitutional court of impeachment, we have never refused \nto look at critical evidence sitting in front of us. We have never \nraced to a pre-ordained verdict while deliberately avoiding the truth \nor evaluating plainly critical evidence.\n  And when I say ``sitting in front of us,'' I mean that literally. \nJust this morning, we learned that Pat Cipollone, lead counsel for the \nPresident, along with Rudy Giuliani and Mick Mulvaney, was part of a \nmeeting where President Trump directed John Bolton to ``ensure \n[President] Zelensky would meet with Mr. Giuliani.'' A meeting with the \nPresident's personal lawyer is not subject to executive privilege; and \na meeting with Bolton and Mulvaney is not subject to attorney-client \nprivilege. And this afternoon we received a proffer from Lev Parnas's \nattorney, claiming that Pamas could provide us with testimony \nimplicating several cabinet officials and members of Congress in the \nPresident's scheme. I cannot say whether that is credible, but \nshouldn't he at least be heard and cross-examined? The Senate cannot \nturn a blind eye to such directly relevant evidence.\n  This slipshod process reminds me of another trial. That was the trial \nof Alice in Wonderland. In that trial, the accusation was read, and the \nKing immediately said to the jury, ``Consider your verdict.'' But even \nin that case it was acknowledged that ``There's a great deal to come \nbefore that,'' and the first witness was called. With apologies to \nLewis Carroll, surely the United States Senate can at least match the \nrigorous criminal procedure of Wonderland?\n  The oath that each of us swore just two weeks ago requires that we do \n``impartial justice.'' Reasonable people can disagree about what that \nmeans, but every single time this body has sat as a court--every single \ntime--it has heard from witnesses and weighed sworn testimony. We have \nnever been denied the opportunity to hear from critical witnesses with \nfirsthand information. During the Johnson trial, this court heard live \ntestimony from 41 witnesses, including private counsel for the \nPresident and a cabinet secretary. During the Clinton trial, three \nwitnesses were deposed and we considered the grand jury testimony of \nthe President's chief of staff, deputy chief of staff, and White House \nCounsel--plus the grand jury testimony of the President himself. \n``Impartial justice'' cannot mean burying our collective heads in the \nsand, and preventing relevant, probative testimony from being taken.\n  Briefly, I also want to address the arguments made against calling \nwitnesses. The President has said that ``Witnesses are up to the House, \nnot up to the Senate.'' But the Senate has never been, and should not \nbe now, limited to the House record. The Senate's constitutional \nobligation to try impeachments stands independent of the House's \nobligation. The Constitution does not allow the House's action or \ninaction to limit the evidence and testimony the Senate can and must \nconsider. The last time we sat as a court we heard from 26 witnesses in \ntotal, including 17 who had not testified before the House. Seventeen.\n  Some have also said that calling witnesses like John Bolton would \nleave us tangled up in an endless court battle over executive \nprivilege. Not so. The Senate alone has the ``sole Power to try all \nImpeachments,'' and the Chief Justice reminded us just a few years ago \nin Zivotofsky v. Clinton that Article III courts cannot hear cases \n``where there `is a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of \nthe issue to a coordinate political department.' '' And in Walter Nixon \nv. United States, the Supreme Court expressly ruled out ``[j]udicial \ninvolvement in impeachment proceedings, even if only for purposes of \njudicial review.''\n  Moreover, and more simply, executive privilege cannot prevent \ntestimony from a private citizen like Bolton who is willing to testify. \nAnd, in any event, the President has almost certainly waived any claim \nto privilege by endlessly tweeting and talking to the media about his \nconversations with Bolton. The Senate is not helpless. We are the only \ncourt with jurisdiction. We can and should resolve these questions.\n  Let us conduct this trial with the seriousness it deserves--\nconsistent with Senate precedent, the overwhelming expectations of the \nAmerican people, and how every other trial across the country is \nconducted every single day.\n  As Senators, we are here to debate and vote on difficult questions. I \nunderstand this may be a difficult question politically--but it is \nnowhere close to a difficult question under the law or common sense. I \ndo not believe for one second that any of us sought public office to \nbecome an accomplice to what can only be described as a cover-up. As \nthe Chief Justice has reminded us, we have the privilege of serving in \nthe world's greatest deliberative body. So let's actually deliberate.\n  But if we adopt the rule--rejected even in Wonderland--of verdict \nfirst, witnesses later, be assured those witnesses will eventually \nfollow. Whether through FOIA, journalism, or book releases, the \nAmerican people will learn the truth, likely sooner rather than later. \nMaybe even over the upcoming weekend. What will they think of a Senate \nthat went to such extraordinary lengths--ignoring 220 years of \nprecedent, any notions of fairness or respect for facts, and indeed \nignoring our duties to the Constitution itself--to keep the truth \nburied?\n  A vote to preclude witnesses will embolden this President to further \ndemean the Congress, this Senate, and the balance of power so carefully \nestablished by the Framers in the Constitution. It will ratify the \nPresident's shell game of telling the House it should sue to enforce \nits subpoenas, and then telling courts that the House has no standing \nto do so. Just today, after a week\n\n\nof his counsel arguing that the President cannot be impeached for \nfailing to respond to House subpoenas, the Justice Department argued in \ncourt that the House can use its impeachment power to enforce its \nsubpoenas. It is up to all 100 of us to put a stop to this nonsense.\n  I have served in this body for 45 years. It is not often we face \nvotes like this--votes that will leave a significant mark on history, \nand will shape our constitutional ability to serve as a check against \npresidents for generations to come. I pray the Senate is worthy of this \nresponsibility, and of this moment. I fear the repercussions if it is \nnot.\n  I will vote to hear from witnesses. With deep respect, I ask my \nfellow senators to do the same.", "turn": 69, "speaker_bioguide": "L000174", "itemno": 86}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "Mr. ENZI", "text": "  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the trial of \nPresident Trump.\n  After information from more than a dozen witnesses, over a hundred \nquestions, and days of oral arguments, I believe the House failed to \nprove its case for the two Articles of Impeachment. The House's story \nrelies on too much speculation, guessing games and repetition. It fails \nto hold up under scrutiny. The House claims to have proven its case, \nbut insists on more evidence. It was the House's responsibility to \nensure it had developed a complete record of the evidence it needed to \nmake its case, and it is not up to the Senate to start the process over \nagain.\n  There were contradictions in the House's case from the very \nbeginning. The House counted on repetition to make its claims seem \ntrue, but often didn't provide the underlying evidence. For example, \nthe House managers relied on telephone records for timing, but \nspeculated on the content of the calls.\n  The House managers claimed the President wanted to influence an \nelection, but it is difficult to see how the House's rush to bring this \ncase in such a haphazard manner is nothing more than an attempt to \ninfluence the 2020 election. The House managers asked the Senate to do \nadditional witnesses in 1 week, which could mean the Senate would \nessentially have to start the trial all over.\n  I not only can't call their efforts adequate, I have to say they have \nbeen entirely inadequate. Consequently, I did not vote for more \nwitnesses or more evidence and will vote to acquit the President on \nboth counts.\n  I hope we can learn from everything we do, especially in regard to \nimpeachment. The animosity toward President Trump is unprecedented, and \nI believe it is the reason we have ended up where we are today. I \nbelieve we should give each newly elected President a chance to show \nwhat he or she can do. We should provide them the opportunity to prove \nthemselves and demonstrate our faith in our country and its leadership.\n  We have to give the President an opportunity to lead or even to fail. \nUnfortunately, President Trump was promised an impeachment from the day \nhe was elected, before he even took his oath of office. On the day of \nhis inauguration, before any official act, there were riots where, and \nI quote from the New York Times, ``protesters threw rocks and bricks at \npolice officers, set a car on fire and shattered storefront windows.'' \nI have never seen that kind of conduct before stemming from the result \nof our democratic process. I hope to never see it again.\n  The obstruction continued as President Trump's nominations were held \nup in an unprecedented way. This obstruction kept the new President \nfrom getting his key people in place. The few nominations approved had \nto work with career or hold-over staff from the previous \nadministration. We have read in news articles that some of those \nstaffers not only disliked their new bosses, but they tried to actively \nundercut their policies. Sometimes they even delayed or used inaction \nor gave adverse advice. These types of tactics were used to put blame \non their boss and on President Trump, and that ultimately hurt our \ncountry, too.\n  Again, almost immediately after the election came the call for \ninvestigations, ending with the appointment of Special Counsel Robert \nMueller. This investigation went on for almost 2 years. When the \nMueller investigation didn't yield the desired results, the President's \ndetractors returned to the continuing cry for an impeachment. The \nvolume and pitch increased even as the 2020 election got closer.\n  Eventually, the House of Representatives found its latest accusation. \nYet, not willing to conduct a thorough impeachment investigation and \nwanting to reach a foregone conclusion as the election year approached, \nthe House of Representatives hurried its investigation so it would be \ndone before Christmas and the Senate would be forced to address these \narticles as a new year started. Ironically, after all that rushing and \ntaking shortcuts, the House delayed sending the articles to the Senate \nuntil the new year. All of this was just the latest example of the \nefforts to block President Trump's agenda.\n  I have now served in two Presidential impeachment trials, one during \nmy first term and this one in my last. I have never underestimated the \nresponsibility of the task at hand or forgotten the oaths I took to \nuphold the Constitution. There are few duties senators will face as \ngrave as deciding the fate of the President of the United States, but \njust like 21 years ago, this decision is about country, not politics. \nThese experiences have helped refine my views, which I will now share.\n  Our Forefathers did well setting the trial in the Senate where it \ntakes a \\2/3\\ majority, currently 67 votes, to convict. They could see \nthe difficulty it would bring to the Nation if impeachment could easily \nbe convicted by a slight majority. Even though it is not the law, I \nwould counsel the House not to impeach without at least a \\3/5\\ vote in \ntheir own body, and that should include some number from the minority \nparty.\n  I have also come to believe that impeachment should be primarily \nabout a criminal activity. Impeachment is inherently undemocratic \nbecause it reverses an election, so in election years, the bar for \nconsidering impeachment and removal goes even higher. Ultimately, the \nAmerican people should and will have the final say.\n  The House of Representatives must also be sure to complete its \ninvestigation. It shouldn't send the Senate impeachment charges and \nthen expect the Senate to continue gathering more evidence. The House \nshould subpoena witnesses and deal with defense claims such as \nprivilege, even if that means going through the judicial process rather \nthan placing such a burden on the Senate.\n  The House cannot simply rely on repetition of possibilities of \nviolations, no matter how many times stated, to make their accusations \ntrue. A complete investigation means the investigators don't rush to \njudgment, don't speculate about the content of calls, and don't rely on \nrepetition of accusations about the content of such calls as a \nsubstitute for seeking the truth.\n  During the initial investigation, witnesses should have already been \ndeposed by both sides before it comes to the Senate. The President's \ncounsel must be allowed to cross-examine all persons deposed by the \nHouse. Then, and only then, can any of the witnesses be called to \ntestify at the Senate trial. The House investigation has to be \ncomplete.\n  Finally, I would call for our outside institutions to also think \nabout how they contribute to the well-being of our country. I have \noften said that conflict sells. It might even increase sales to \nconsumers of news for both parties, but I fear that we are all treating \nthis like a sport, speculating which team will win and which will lose. \nI suspect that some venomous statements about this process have ended \nsome friendships and strained some families. In the end, if we lose \nfaith in our institutions, our friends and our families, we will all \nlose.\n  We desperately need more civility. That is simply being nice to each \nother. My mom said, ``Bad behavior is inexcusable.'' It violates the \nGolden Rule as revised by my mom, ``Do what's right. Do your best. \nTreat others as THEY wish to be treated.'' One of the first movies I \nsaw was the now-ancient animated picture, ``Bambi.'' I am reminded of \nthe little rabbit saying, ``My Mom always says, if you can't say \nsomething nice, don't say anything at all!'' I believe we all agree on \nat least 80 percent of most issues, but the trend seems to be shifting \nto concentrate on the other 20 percent we don't agree on. That 20 \npercent causes divisiveness, opposition, venomous harsh words, and \nanger.\n\n\n  Too often, it feels like our Nation is only becoming more divided, \nmore hostile. I do not believe that our country will ever be able to \nsuccessfully tackle our looming problems if we continue down this road. \nAs we move forward from this chapter in our Nation's history, I hope \nthat we will focus more on our shared goals that can help our Nation, \nand not the issues that drive us apart.", "turn": 70, "speaker_bioguide": "E000285", "itemno": 87}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "Mr. BURR", "text": "  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, in my 25 years representing North Carolina \nin Congress, I have cast thousands of votes, each with its own \nsignificance. The ones that weigh most heavily are those that send our \nmen and women in uniform into armed conflict. Those are the votes I \nspend the most time debating before casting--first and foremost because \nof the human cost involved but secondly because they hold the power to \nirrevocably set the course of American history.\n  With similar consideration, I have taken a sober and deliberate \napproach to the impeachment proceedings of the last few weeks, \nconscious of my constitutional responsibility to serve as an impartial \njuror.\n  As the investigative body, the House has charged President Trump with \nabuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The Senate's role is to \ndetermine whether the House has proven its case beyond a reasonable \ndoubt and whether, if true, these charges rise to the level of removing \nthe President from office.\n  After listening to more than 70 hours of arguments from the House \nmanagers and the President's counsel, I have concluded that the House \nhas not provided the Senate with a compelling reason for taking the \nunprecedented and destabilizing step of removing the President from \noffice.\n  In my role as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I have \nvisited countries all over the world. What separates the United States \nfrom every other nation on Earth is our predictable, peaceful \ntransitions of power. Every 4 years, Americans cast their ballots with \nthe confidence their vote will be counted and the knowledge that both \nwinners and losers will abide by the results.\n  To remove a U.S. President from office, for the first time in \nhistory, on anything less than overwhelming evidence of ``Treason, \nBribery, or High Crimes and Misdemeanors'' would effectively overturn \nthe will of the American people.\n  As the Speaker said last year, ``Impeachment is so divisive to the \ncountry that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming \nand bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path, because it \ndivides the country.''\n  I believe the Speaker was correct in her assessment. A year later, \nhowever, the House went down that exact path, choosing to conduct a \nhighly partisan impeachment inquiry, with underwhelming evidence, in a \ndeeply flawed process.\n  The House had ample opportunity to pursue the answers to its inquiry \nin order to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. They chose not \nto do so. Instead, investigators followed an arbitrary, self-imposed \ntimeline dictated by political, rather than substantive, concerns.\n  For example, the House did not attempt to compel certain witnesses to \ntestify because doing so would have meant confronting issues of \nexecutive privilege and immunity. They argued navigating executive \nprivilege--something every administration lays claim to--may have \ncaused some level of delays and involved the courts.\n  At the time, the House justified their decision by claiming the issue \nwas too important, too urgent, for any delays. Yet, after the House \nvoted on the Articles of Impeachment, the Speaker waited 4 full weeks \nbefore transmitting the articles to the Senate. Those were weeks the \nHouse could have spent furthering its inquiry, had it not rushed the \nprocess. Instead, without a hint of irony, House leadership attempted \nto use that time to pressure the Senate into gathering the very witness \ntestimony their own investigators chose not to pursue.\n  Additionally, in drafting the Articles of Impeachment, the House \nstated President Trump committed ``Criminal bribery and honest services \nwire fraud,'' two crimes that carry penalties under our Criminal Code. \nInexplicably, the House chose not to include those alleged criminal \nmisdeeds in the articles sent to the Senate, much less argue them in \nfront of this body.\n  At every turn, it appears the House made decisions not based on the \npursuit of justice but on politics. When due process threatened to slow \ndown the march forward, they took shortcuts. When evidence was too \ncomplicated to obtain or an accusation did not carry weight, the House \ncreated new, flimsy standards on the fly, hoping public pressure would \nsway Senate jurors in lieu of facts.\n  The Founding Fathers who crafted our modern impeachment mechanism \npredicted this moment, and warned against a solely partisan and \npolitically motivated process.\n  In Federalist 65, Alexander Hamilton wrote, ``In many cases \n[impeachment] will connect itself with the pre-existing factions, and \nwill enlist all their animosities, partialities, influence, and \ninterest on one side or on the other; and in such cases there will \nalways be the greatest danger that the decision will be regulated more \nby the comparative strength of parties, than by the real demonstrations \nof innocence or guilt.''\n  Hamilton believed impeachment was a necessary tool but one to be used \nwhen the evidence of wrongdoing was so overwhelming, it elevated the \nprocess above partiality and partisanship. The House has failed to meet \nthat standard.\n  The Founders also warned against using impeachment as recourse for \nmanagement or policy disagreements with the President.\n  Prior to America's founding, impeachment had been used for centuries \nin England as a measure to reprimand crown-appointed officials and \nlanded gentry. At the time, it included the vague charge of \n``maladministration,'' as well.\n  During the Constitutional Convention in 1787, George Mason moved to \nadd ``maladministration'' to the U.S. Constitution's list of \nimpeachable offenses, asking: ``Why is the provision restrained to \nTreason & bribery only? Treason as defined in the Constitution will not \nreach many great and dangerous offences. Attempts to subvert the \nConstitution may not be Treason as above defined.''\n  I submit for this body James Madison's response: ``So vague a term \nwill be equivalent to a tenure during the pleasure of the Senate.''\n  Madison knew that impeachment based purely on disagreements about \ngovernance would turn the U.S. Congress into a parliamentary body, akin \nto those tumultuous coalitions in Europe, which could recall a \nPresident on little more than a whim. To do so would subordinate the \nExecutive to the Congress, rather than delineating its role as a \ncoequal branch of our Federal Government. And with political winds \nchanging as frequently then as they do now, he saw that every President \ncould theoretically be thus impeached on fractious and uncertain terms.\n  In a functioning democracy, the President cannot serve at ``the \npleasure of Senate.'' He must serve at the pleasure of the people.\n  Gouverneur Morris supported Madison's argument, adding at the time: \n``An election every four years will prevent maladministration.''\n  Thus ``maladministration'' was not made an impeachable offense in \nAmerica, expressly because we have the recourse of free and fair \nelections.\n  I bring up this story for two reasons. First, the Founder's decision \nsignals to me they felt strongly that an impeachable offense must be a \ncrime akin to treason, bribery, or an act equally serious, as defined \nin the Criminal Code. Second, this story tells me the Founders believed \nanything that does not meet the Constitutional threshold should be \nnavigated through the electoral process.\n  By that standard, I do not believe the Articles of Impeachment \npresented to the Senate rise to the level of removal from office, nor \ndo I believe House managers succeeded in making the case incumbent upon \nthem to prove. Given the weak underpinnings of the articles themselves \nand the House's partisan process, it would be an error to remove the \nPresident mere months before a national election; therefore, I have \nconcluded I will vote to acquit President Donald J. Trump on both \narticles of impeachment.", "turn": 71, "speaker_bioguide": "B001135", "itemno": 88}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "Ms. KLOBUCHAR", "text": "  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, today is a somber day for our country.\n\n\nAs Senators, we are here as representatives of the American people. It \nis our duty, as we each swore to do when we took our oath of office, to \nsupport and defend the Constitution. We also took an oath, as judges \nand jurors in this proceeding, to pursue ``impartial justice'' as we \nconsider these articles--including the serious charge that the \nPresident of the United States leveraged the power of his office for \nhis own personal gain.\n  Those are the oaths that the Framers set out for us in the \nConstitution, to guide the Senate in its oversight responsibilities. \nThe Framers believed that the legislative branch was best positioned to \nprovide a check on the Executive. They envisioned that the separation \nof powers would allow each branch of government to oversee the other. \nThey also knew, based on their experience living under the British \nmonarchy, that someday a President might corrupt the powers of the \noffice. William Davie from North Carolina was particularly concerned \nthat a President could abuse his office by sparing ``no efforts or \nmeans whatever to get himself reelected.''\n  So the Framers put in place a standard that would cover a range of \nPresidential misconduct, settling on: ``Treason, Bribery, or other high \nCrimes and Misdemeanors.'' As Alexander Hamilton explained in \nFederalist 65, the phrase was intended to cover the ``abuse or \nviolation of some public trust'' and ``injuries done immediately to \nsociety itself.'' The Framers designed a remedy for this public harm: \nremoval from public office. So now we are here as judge and jury to try \nthe case and to evaluate whether the President's acts have violated the \npublic trust and injured our democracy.\n  I am concerned of course that the Senate has decided that we must \nmake this decision without all the facts. With a 51 to 49 vote, the \nsenate blocked the opportunity to call witnesses with firsthand \nknowledge or to get relevant documents. Fairness means evidence--it \nmeans documents, and it means witnesses. In every past impeachment \ntrial in the Senate, in this body's entire 231-year history, there have \nbeen witnesses. There is no reason why the Senate should not have \ncalled people to testify who have firsthand knowledge of the \nPresident's conduct, especially if, as some of my colleagues have \nsuggested, you believe the facts are in dispute.\n  During the question period, I asked about the impeachment of Judge \nPorteous in 2010. I joined several of my colleagues in serving on the \ntrial committee. We heard from 26 witnesses in the Senate, 17 of whom \nwere new witnesses who had not previously testified in the House. What \npossible reason could there be for allowing 26 witnesses in a judicial \nimpeachment trial and zero in a President's trial? How can we consider \nthis a fair trial if we are not even willing to try and get to the \ntruth?\n  We do not even have to try and find it. John Bolton has firsthand \nknowledge about central facts in this case, and he said he would comply \nwith a subpoena from the Senate. We also know there are documents that \ncould verify testimony presented in the House, like records of emails \nsent between administration officials in the days after the July 25 \ncall. We cannot ignore this evidence--we have a constitutional duty to \nconsider it.\n  And since this trial began, new evidence has continued to emerge. One \nway or another, the truth is going to come out. I believe that history \nwill remember that the majority in this body did not seek out the \nevidence and instead decided that the President's alleged corrupt acts \ndid not even require a closer look.\n  But even without firsthand accounts and without primary documents, \nthe House managers have presented a compelling case. I was particularly \ninterested in the evidence that the managers presented showing that the \nPresident's conduct put our national security at risk by jeopardizing \nour support for Ukraine.\n  Protecting Ukraine's fragile democracy has been a bipartisan \npriority. I went to Ukraine with the late Senator John McCain and \nSenator Lindsey Graham right after the 2016 election to make clear that \nthe United States would continue to support our ally Ukraine in the \nface of Russian aggression--that we will stand up for democracy. As the \nHouse managers stressed, it is in our national security interest to \nstrengthen Ukraine's democracy. The United States has 60,000 troops \nstationed in Europe, and thousands of Ukrainians have died fighting \nRussian forces and their proxies.\n  Our Nation's support for Ukraine is critically needed. Ukraine is at \nthe frontline of Russian aggression, and since the Russians invaded \nCrimea in 2014, the United States has provided over $1.5 billion in \naid. Russia is watching everything we do. So this summer, as a new \nUkrainian President prepared to lead his country and address the war \nwith Russia, it was critical that President Trump showed the world that \nwe stand with Ukraine. Instead, President Trump decided to withhold \nmilitary security assistance and to deny the Ukrainian President an \nOval Office meeting. In doing so, he jeopardized our national security \ninterests and put the Ukrainians in danger. But worse yet, he did so to \nbenefit himself.\n  Testimony from the 17 current and former officials from the \nPresident's administration made it clear that the President leveraged \nthe power of his office to pressure Ukraine to announce an \ninvestigation into his political rival. These brave public servants \ndefied the President's order and agreed to testify about what happened \ndespite the risks to their careers. Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine \nMarie Yovanovitch showed particular courage, testifying before the \nHouse even as the President disparaged her on Twitter. And I will never \nforget when Lieutenant Colonel Vindman testified and sent a message to \nhis immigrant father, saying, ``Don't worry Dad, I will be fine for \ntelling the truth.''\n  As Manager Schiff said, in our country ``right matters.'' What is \nright and wrong under our Constitution does not turn on whether or not \nyou like the President. It is not about whether the disregard for its \nboundaries furthers policies that you agree or disagree with. It is \nabout whether it remains true that in our country, right matters. \nThrough his actions, the President compromised the security of our ally \nUkraine, invited foreign interference in our elections, and undermined \nthe integrity of our democratic process--conduct that I believe the \nFramers would see as an abuse of power and violation of his oath of \noffice.\n  The Articles of Impeachment include a second charge: that the \nPresident used the powers of his office to prevent Congress from \ninvestigating his actions and attempted to place himself above the law.\n  Unlike any President before him, President Trump categorically \nrefused to comply with any requests from Congress. Even President Nixon \ndirected ``all the president's men'' to comply with congressional \nrequests. Despite that history, President Trump directed every member \nof his administration not to comply with requests to testify and also \ndirected the executive branch not to release a single document.\n  The President's refusal to respect the Congress's authority is a \ndirect threat to the separation of powers. The Constitution gives the \nHouse the ``sole power of impeachment,'' a tool of last resort to \nprovide a check on the president. By refusing to cooperate, the \nPresident is attempting to erase the Congress's constitutional power \nand to prevent the American people from learning of his misconduct. As \nwe discussed during our questions, the President is asserting that his \naides have absolute immunity, a proposition that Federal courts have \nconsistently rejected. Manager Demings warned, ``absolute power \ncorrupts absolutely.''\n  But this President has taken many steps to place himself above the \nlaw. This administration has taken the position that a sitting \nPresident cannot be indicted or prosecuted. This President has argued \nthat he is immune from State and criminal investigations. And now we \nare being asked to say that the Constitution's check on a President's \npower, as set out by the Framers, cannot prevent a President from \nabusing his power and covering it up.\n  During the trial, we have heard this directly from the President's \ndefense. In the words of Alan Dershowitz, ``If a president does \nsomething which he believes will help him get elected--in the public \ninterest--that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in \nimpeachment.'' These echo the words of\n\n\nan impeached President, Richard Nixon, who said: ``When the president \ndoes it, that means it is not illegal.'' We cannot accept that \nconclusion. In this country the President is not King, the law is King. \nBut if the Senate looks past the President's defiance of Congress, we \nwill forever undermine our status as a coequal branch and undermine the \nrule of law.\n  So as we consider these Articles of Impeachment, I ask my colleagues \nto think about the consequences. Our system, designed by the Framers \n232 years ago, is one not of absolute power but of power through and by \nthe people. We are, in some ways, faced with the same question the \nFounders faced when they made the fateful decision to challenge the \nunchecked power of a King.\n  When signing the Declaration of Independence, John Hancock signed his \nname large and said, ``There must be no pulling different ways. We must \nall hang together.'' Benjamin Franklin replied, ``Yes, we must, indeed, \nall hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately.''\n  We have the opportunity today to stand together and say that the \nConstitution, that these United States, are stronger than our enemies, \nforeign and domestic, and we, together, are stronger than a President \nwho would corrupt our democracy with an abuse of power and an attempt \nto deny the rights of a coequal branch of government. We do not have to \nagree on everything today or tomorrow or a year from now, but surely we \ncan agree on the same basic principles: that this is a government of \nlaws, not of men-and women; that in this country, no one is above the \nlaw. If we can agree on that much, then I submit to my colleagues that \nthe choice before us is clear.", "turn": 72, "speaker_bioguide": "K000367", "itemno": 89}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "Mr. SANDERS", "text": "  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, an impeachment trial of a sitting \nPresident of the United States is not a matter to be taken lightly. A \nPresident should not and must not be impeached because of political \ndisagreements or policy differences. That is what elections are for. \nInstead, an impeachment trial occurs when a President violates the oath \nhe or she swore to uphold the Constitution of the United States.\n  Therefore, there are two questions for me to answer as a juror in the \nimpeachment trial of President Donald J. Trump: whether President Trump \nis guilty of abusing his power as President for his own political gain \nand whether he obstructed Congress in their investigation of him.\n  The first Article of Impeachment charges President Trump with abuse \nof power when he ``solicited the interference of a foreign government, \nUkraine, in the 2020 United States Presidential election.'' Based on \nthe evidence I heard during the Senate trial, Trump ``corruptly \nsolicited'' an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and \nhis son in order to benefit his own reelection chances. To increase the \npressure on Ukraine, President Trump then withheld approximately $400 \nmillion in military aid from Ukraine. Finally, according to the \ncharges, even when Trump's scheme to withhold aid was made public, he \n``persisted in openly and corruptly urging and soliciting Ukraine to \nundertake investigations for his personal political benefit.'' So on \nthis first Article of Impeachment, it is my view that the President is \nclearly guilty.\n  The second Article of Impeachment asserts that Trump obstructed \nCongress in its investigation of Trump's abuse of power, stating that \nTrump ``has directed the unprecedented, categorical, and indiscriminate \ndefiance of subpoenas issued by the House of Representatives pursuant \nto its `sole Power of Impeachment.' '' According to the warped logic of \nthe arguments presented by the President's counsel, there are almost no \nlegal bounds to anything a President can do so long as it benefits his \nown reelection. If a President cannot be investigated criminally or by \nCongress while in office, then he or she would be effectively above the \nlaw. President Trump, who raised absurd legal arguments to hide his \nactions and obstruct Congress, is clearly guilty here as well.\n  Now, frankly, while the House of Representatives passed two Articles \nof Impeachment, President Trump could have been impeached for more than \njust that.\n  For example, it seems clear that Donald Trump has violated both the \ndomestic and foreign emoluments clauses. In other words, it appears \nTrump has used the Federal Government over and over to benefit himself \nfinancially.\n  In 2018 alone, Trump's organization made over $40 million in profit \njust from his Trump hotel in DC alone. And foreign governments, \nincluding lobbying firms connected to the Saudi Arabian Government, \nhave spent hundreds of thousands of dollars at that hotel. That appears \nto be corruption, pure and simple.\n  In addition, as we all know, there is significant evidence that \nDonald Trump committed obstruction of justice with regard to the Robert \nMueller investigation by, among other actions, firing the FBI Director, \nJames Comey.\n  One of the difficulties of dealing with President Trump and his \nadministration is that we cannot trust his words. He is a pathological \nliar who, according to media research, has lied thousands of times \nsince he was elected. During the trial, I posed a question to the House \nimpeachment managers: Given that the media has documented President \nTrump's thousands of lies while in office--more than 16,200 as of \nJanuary 20, 2020--why would we be expected to believe that anything \nPresident Trump says has credibility? The answer is that, sadly, we \ncannot.\n  Sadly, we now have a President who sees himself as above the law and \nis either ignorant or indifferent to the Constitution. And we have a \nPresident who clearly committed impeachable offenses.\n  The evidence of Trump's guilt is so overwhelming that the Republican \nParty, for the first time in the history of Presidential impeachment, \nobstructed testimony from witnesses--even willing witnesses. It defies \nbasic common sense that in a trial to determine whether the President \nof the United States is above the law, the Senate would not hear from \nthe people who could speak directly to President Trump's behavior and \nmotive. Leader Mitch McConnell's handling of this trial, unfortunately, \nwas nothing more than a political act.\n  Yet this impeachment trial is about more than just the charges \nagainst President Trump. What this impeachment vote will decide is \nwhether we believe that the President, any President, is above the law.\n  Last week, Alan Dershowitz, one of President Trump's lawyers, argued \nto the Senate that a President cannot be impeached for any actions he \nor she takes that are intended to benefit their own reelection. That is \ntruly an extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion. If Trump is \nacquitted, I fear the repercussions of this argument would do grave \ndamage to the rule of law in our country.\n  Imagine what such a precedent would allow an incumbent president to \nget away with for the sake of their own reelection. Hacking an \nopponent's email using government resources? Soliciting election \ninterference from China? Under this argument, what would stop a \nPresident from withholding infrastructure or education funding to a \ngiven State to pressure elected officials into helping the President \npolitically?\n  Let me be clear: Republicans will set a dangerous and lawless \nprecedent if they vote to acquit President Trump. A Republican \nacquittal of Donald Trump won't just mean that the current President is \nabove the law; it will give a green light to all future Presidents to \ndisregard the law so long as it benefits their reelection.\n  It gives me no pleasure to conclude that President Donald Trump is \nguilty of the offenses laid out in the two Articles of Impeachment. I \nwill vote to convict on both counts. But my greater concern is if \nRepublicans acquit President Trump by undercutting the very rule of \nlaw. That will truly be remembered as a sad and dangerous moment in the \nhistory of our country.", "turn": 73, "speaker_bioguide": "S000033", "itemno": 90}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "Mr. TOOMEY", "text": "  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the House Articles \nof Impeachment against President Donald Trump.\n  In 1999, then-Senator Joe Biden of Delaware asked the following \nquestion during the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton: ``[D]o \nthese actions rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors \nnecessary to justify the most obviously antidemocratic act the Senate \ncan engage in--overturning an election by convicting the president?'' \nHe answered his own question by voting against removing President \nClinton from office.\n\n\n  It is this constitutionally grounded framework--articulated well by \nVice President Biden--that guided my review of President Trump's \nimpeachment and, ultimately, my decision to oppose his removal.\n  House Democrats' impeachment articles allege that President Trump \nbriefly paused aid and withheld a White House meeting with Ukraine's \nPresident to pressure Ukraine into investigating two publicly reported \ncorruption matters. The first matter was possible Ukrainian \ninterference in our 2016 election. The second was Vice President \nBiden's role in firing the controversial Ukrainian prosecutor \ninvestigating a company on whose board Vice President Biden's son sat. \nWhen House Democrats demanded witnesses and documents concerning the \nPresident's conduct, he invoked constitutional rights and resisted \ntheir demands.\n  The President's actions were not ``perfect.'' Some were \ninappropriate. But the question before the Senate is not whether his \nactions were perfect; it is whether they constitute impeachable \noffenses that justify removing a sitting President from office for the \nfirst time and forbidding him from seeking office again.\n  Let's consider the case against President Trump: obstruction of \nCongress and abuse of power. On obstruction, House Democrats allege the \nPresident lacked ``lawful cause or excuse'' to resist their subpoenas. \nThis ignores that his resistance was based on constitutionally grounded \nlegal defenses and immunities that are consistent with longstanding \npositions taken by administrations of both parties. Instead of \nnegotiating a resolution or litigating in court, House Democrats rushed \nto impeach. But as House Democrats noted during President Clinton's \nimpeachment, a President's defense of his legal and constitutional \nrights and responsibilities is not an impeachable offense.\n  House Democrats separately allege President Trump abused his power by \nconditioning a White House meeting and the release of aid on Ukraine \nagreeing to pursue corruption investigations. Their case rests entirely \non the faulty claim that the only possible motive for his actions was \nhis personal political gain. In fact, there are also legitimate \nnational interests for seeking investigations into apparent corruption, \nespecially when taxpayer dollars are involved.\n  Here is what ultimately occurred: President Trump met with Ukraine's \nPresident, and the aid was released after a brief pause. These actions \nhappened without Ukraine announcing or conducting investigations. The \nidea that President Trump committed an impeachable offense by meeting \nwith Ukraine's President at the United Nations in New York instead of \nWashington, DC is absurd. Moreover, the pause in aid did not hinder \nUkraine's ability to combat Russia. In fact, as witnesses in the House \nimpeachment proceedings stated, U.S. policy in support of Ukraine is \nstronger under President Trump than under President Obama.\n  Even if House Democrats' presumptions about President Trump's motives \nare true, additional witnesses in the Senate, beyond the 17 witnesses \nwho testified in the House impeachment proceedings, are unnecessary \nbecause the President's actions do not rise to the level of removing \nhim from office, nor do they warrant the societal upheaval that would \nresult from his removal from office and the ballot months before an \nelection. Our country is already far too divided and this would only \nmake matters worse.\n  As Vice President Biden also stated during President Clinton's \nimpeachment trial, ``[t]here is no question the Constitution sets the \nbar for impeachment very high.'' A President can only be impeached and \nremoved for ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and \nMisdemeanors.'' While there is debate about the precise meaning of \n``other high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' it is clear that impeachable \nconduct must be comparable to the serious offenses of treason and \nbribery.\n  The Constitution sets the impeachment bar so high for good reasons. \nRemoving a President from office and forbidding him from seeking future \noffice overturns the results of the last election and denies Americans \nthe right to vote for him in the next one. The Senate's impeachment \npower essentially allows 67 Senators to substitute their judgment for \nthe judgment of millions of Americans.\n  The framework Vice President Biden articulated in 1999 for judging an \nimpeachment was right then, and it is right now. President Trump's \nconduct does not meet the very high bar required to justify overturning \nthe election, removing him from office, and kicking him off the ballot \nin an election that has already begun. In November, the American people \nwill decide for themselves whether President Trump should stay in \noffice. In our democratic system, that is the way it should be.", "turn": 74, "speaker_bioguide": "T000461", "itemno": 91}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "Mr. RUBIO", "text": "  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, voting to find the President guilty in the \nSenate is not simply a finding of wrongdoing; it is a vote to remove a \nPresident from office for the first time in the 243-year history of our \nRepublic.\n  When they decided to include impeachment in the Constitution, the \nFramers understood how disruptive and traumatic it would be. As \nAlexander Hamilton warned, impeachment will ``agitate the passions of \nthe whole community.''\n  This is why they decided to require the support of two-thirds of the \nSenate to remove a President we serve as a guardrail against partisan \nimpeachment and against removal of a President without broad public \nsupport.\n  Leaders in both parties previously recognized that impeachment must \nbe bipartisan and must enjoy broad public support. In fact, as recently \nas March of last year, Manager Adam Schiff said there would be ``little \nto be gained by putting the country through'' the ``wrenching \nexperience'' of a partisan impeachment. Yet, only a few months later, a \npartisan impeachment is exactly what the House produced. This meant two \nArticles of Impeachment whose true purpose was not to protect the \nNation but, rather, to, as Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, stain the \nPresident's record because ``he has been impeached forever'' and ``they \ncan never erase that.''\n  It now falls upon this Senate to take up what the House produced and \nfaithfully execute our duties under the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  Why does impeachment exist?\n  As manager Jerry Nadler reminded us last week, removal is not a \npunishment for a crime, nor is removal supposed to be a way to hold \nPresidents accountable; that is what elections are for. The sole \npurpose of this extraordinary power to remove the one person entrusted \nwith all of the powers of an entire branch of government is to provide \na last-resort remedy to protect the country. That is why Hamilton wrote \nthat in these trials our decisions should be pursuing ``the public \ngood.''\n  Even before the trial, I announced that, for me, the question would \nnot just be whether the President's actions were wrong but ultimately \nwhether what he did was removable. The two are not the same. It is \npossible for an offense to meet a standard of impeachment and yet not \nbe in the best interest of the country to remove a President from \noffice.\n  To answer this question, the first step was to ask whether it would \nserve the public good to remove the President, even if the managers had \nproven every allegation they made. It was not difficult to answer that \nquestion on the charge of obstruction of congress. The President \navailed himself of legal defenses and constitutional privileges on the \nadvice of his legal counsel. He has taken a position identical to that \nof every other administration in the last 50 years. That is not an \nimpeachable offense, much less a removable one.\n  Negotiations with Congress and enforcement in the courts, not \nimpeachment, should be the front-line recourse when Congress and the \nPresident disagree on the separation of powers. But here, the House \nfailed to go to court because, as Manager Schiff admitted, they did not \nwant to go through a yearlong exercise to get the information they \nwanted. Ironically, they now demand that the Senate go through this \nvery long exercise they themselves decided to avoid.\n  On the first Article of Impeachment, I reject the argument that abuse \nof power can never constitute grounds for removal unless a crime or a \ncrime-like action is alleged. However, even if the House managers had \nbeen able to prove every allegation made in article I,\n\n\nwould it be in the interest of the Nation to remove the President? \nAnswering this question requires a political judgment--one that takes \ninto account both the severity of the wrongdoing they allege and the \nimpact removal would have on the Nation.\n  I disagree with the House Managers' argument that, if we find the \nallegations they have made are true, failing to remove the President \nleaves us with no remedy to constrain this or future Presidents. \nCongress and the courts have multiple ways by which to constrain the \npower of the Executive. And ultimately, voters themselves can hold the \nPresident accountable in an election, including the one just 9 months \nfrom now.\n  I also considered removal in the context of the bitter divisions and \ndeep polarization our country currently faces. The removal of the \nPresident--especially one based on a narrowly voted impeachment, \nsupported by one political party and opposed by another and without \nbroad public support--would, as Manager Nadler warned over two decades \nago, ``produce divisiveness and bitterness'' that will threaten our \nNation for decades. Can anyone doubt that at least half of the country \nwould view his removal as illegitimate--as nothing short of a coup \nd'etat? It is difficult to conceive of any scheme Putin could undertake \nthat would undermine confidence in our democracy more than removal \nwould.\n  I also reject the argument that unless we call new witnesses, this is \nnot a fair trial. First, they cannot argue that fairness demands we \nseek witnesses they did little to pursue. Second, even if new witnesses \nwould testify to the truth of the allegations made, these allegations, \neven if they had been able to prove them, would not warrant the \nPresident's removal.\n  This high bar I have set is not new for me. In 2014, I rejected calls \nto pursue impeachment of President Obama, noting that he ``has two \nyears left in his term,'' and, instead of pursuing impeachment, we \nshould use existing tools at our disposal to ``limit the amount of \ndamage he's doing to our economy and our national security.''\n  Senator Patrick Leahy, the President pro tempore emeritus, once \nwarned, ``[A] partisan impeachment cannot command the respect of the \nAmerican people. It is no more valid than a stolen election.'' His \nwords are more true today than when he said them two decades ago. We \nshould heed his advice.\n  I will not vote to remove the President because doing so would \ninflict extraordinary and potentially irreparable damage to our already \ndivided Nation.", "turn": 75, "speaker_bioguide": "R000595", "itemno": 92}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "Mr. JOHNSON", "text": "  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am glad that this unfortunate chapter \nin American history is over. The strength of our Republic lies in the \nfact that, more often than not, we settle our political differences at \nthe ballot box, not on the streets or battlefield and not through \nimpeachment.\n  Just last year, Speaker Pelosi said that any impeachment ``would have \nto be so clearly bipartisan in terms of acceptance of it.'' And in \n1998, Representative Nadler, currently a House impeachment manager, \nsaid, ``There must never be . . . an impeachment substantially \nsupported by one of our major political parties and largely opposed by \nthe other . . . Such an impeachment would lack legitimacy, would \nproduce divisiveness and bitterness in our politics for years to come . \n. .''\n  And yet, that is exactly what House Democrats passed. I truly wish \nSpeaker Pelosi, Chairman Nadler, and their House colleagues would have \nfollowed their own advice.\n  As I listened to the House managers' closing arguments, I jotted down \nadjectives describing the case they were making: angry, disingenuous, \nhyperbolic, sanctimonious, distorted--if not outright dishonest--and \noverstated; they were making a mountain out of a molehill.\n  Congressman Schiff and the other House managers are not stupid. They \nhad to know that their insults and accusations--that the President had \nthreatened to put our heads on a pike, that the Senate was on trial, \nthat we would be part of the coverup if we didn't cave to their demand \nfor witnesses--would not sway Republican Senators. No, they had another \ngoal in mind. They were using impeachment and their public offices to \naccomplish the very thing they accused President Trump of doing, \ninterfering in the 2020 election.\n  Impeachment should be reserved for the most serious of offenses where \nthe risk to our democracy simply cannot wait for the voters' next \ndecision. That was not the case here.\n  Instead, the greater damage to our democracy would be to ratify a \nhighly partisan House impeachment process that lacked due process and \nsought to impose a duty on the Senate to repair the House's flawed \nproduct. Caving to House managers' demands would have set a dangerous \nprecedent and dramatically altered the constitutional order, further \nweaponizing impeachment and encouraging more of them.\n  Now that the trial is over, I sincerely hope everyone involved has \nrenewed appreciation for the genius of our Founding Fathers and for the \nseparation of powers they incorporated into the U.S. Constitution. I \nalso hope all the players in this national travesty go forward with a \ngreater sense of humility and recognition of the limits the \nConstitution places on their respective offices.\n  I am concerned about the divisiveness and bitterness that Chairman \nNadler warned us about. We are a divided nation, and it often seems the \nlines are only hardening and growing farther apart. But hope lies in \nfinding what binds us together--our love of freedom, our faith, our \nfamilies.\n  We serve those who elect us. It is appropriate and necessary to \nengage in discussion and debate to sway public opinion, but in the end, \nit is essential that we rely upon, respect, and accept the public's \nelectoral decisions.\n  In addition, I ask unanimous consent that my November 18, 2019, \nletter to Congressmen Nunes and Jordan, and the January 22, 2020, Real \nClear Investigations article written by Paul Sperry be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The November 18, 2019, letter responds to Nunes' and Jordan's request \nto provide information regarding my firsthand knowledge of events \nregarding Ukraine that were relevant to the impeachment inquiry.

Specifically, that question \nasked: ``Recent reporting described two NSC staff holdovers from the \nObama administration attending an `all hands' meeting of NSC staff held \nabout two weeks into the Trump administration and talking loudly enough \nto be overheard saying, `we need to do everything we can to take out \nthe president.'

Jim Jordan,\n     Ranking Member,\n     Committee on Oversight and Reform.\n     Hon. Devin Nunes,\n     Ranking Member, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.\n       Dear Congressman Jordan and Congressman Nunes: I am writing \n     in response to the request of Ranking Members Nunes and \n     Jordan to provide my first-hand information and resulting \n     perspective on events relevant to the House impeachment \n     inquiry of President Trump. It is being written in the middle \n     of that inquiry--after most of the depositions have been \n     given behind closed doors, but before all the public hearings \n     have been held.\n       I view this impeachment inquiry as a continuation of a \n     concerted, and possibly coordinated, effort to sabotage the \n     Trump administration that probably began in earnest the day \n     after the 2016 presidential election. The latest evidence of \n     this comes with the reporting of a Jan. 30, 2017 tweet (10 \n     days after Trump's inauguration) by one of the \n     whistleblower's attorneys, Mark Zaid: ``#coup has started. \n     First of many steps. #rebellion. #impeachment will follow \n     ultimately.''\n       But even prior to the 2016 election, the FBI's \n     investigation and exoneration of former Secretary of State \n     Hillary Clinton, combined with Fusion GPS' solicitation and \n     dissemination of the Steele dossier--and the FBI's \n     counterintelligence investigation based on that dossier--laid \n     the groundwork for future sabotage. As a result, my first-\n     hand knowledge and involvement in this\n\n\n     saga began with the revelation that former Secretary of State \n     Hillary Clinton kept a private e-mail server.\n       I have been chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland \n     Security and Governmental Affairs (HSGAC) since January 2015. \n     In addition to its homeland security portfolio, the committee \n     also is charged with general oversight of the federal \n     government. Its legislative jurisdiction includes federal \n     records. So when the full extent of Clinton's use of a \n     private server became apparent in March 2015, HSGAC initiated \n     an oversight investigation.\n       Although many questions remain unanswered from that \n     scandal, investigations resulting from it by a number of \n     committees, reporters and agencies have revealed multiple \n     facts and episodes that are similar to aspects of the latest \n     effort to find grounds for impeachment. In particular, the \n     political bias revealed in the Strzok/Page texts, use of the \n     discredited Steele dossier to initiate and sustain the FBI's \n     counterintelligence investigation and FISA warrants, and \n     leaks to the media that created the false narrative of Trump \n     campaign collusion with Russia all fit a pattern and indicate \n     a game plan that I suspect has been implemented once again. \n     It is from this viewpoint that I report my specific \n     involvement in the events related to Ukraine and the \n     impeachment inquiry.\n       I also am chairman of the Subcommittee on Europe and \n     Regional Security Cooperation of the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee. I have made six separate trips to Ukraine starting \n     in April 2011. Most recently, I led two separate Senate \n     resolutions calling for a strong U.S. and NATO response to \n     Russian military action against Ukraine's navy in the Kerch \n     Strait. I traveled to Ukraine to attend president-elect \n     Volodymyr Zelensky's inauguration held on May 20, and again \n     on Sept. 5 with U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy to meet with Zelensky \n     and other Ukrainian leaders.\n       Following the Orange Revolution, and even more so after the \n     Maidan protests, the Revolution of Dignity, and Russia's \n     illegal annexation of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine, \n     support for the people of Ukraine has been strong within \n     Congress and in both the Obama and Trump administrations. \n     There was also universal recognition and concern regarding \n     the level of corruption that was endemic throughout Ukraine. \n     In 2015, Congress overwhelmingly authorized $300 million of \n     security assistance to Ukraine, of which $50 million was to \n     be available only for lethal defensive weaponry. The Obama \n     administration never supplied the authorized lethal defensive \n     weaponry, but President Trump did.\n       Zelensky won a strong mandate--73%--from the Ukrainian \n     public to fight corruption. His inauguration date was set on \n     very short notice, which made attending it a scheduling \n     challenge for members of Congress who wanted to go to show \n     support. As a result, I was the only member of Congress \n     joining the executive branch's inaugural delegation led by \n     Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Special Envoy Kurt Volker, U.S. \n     Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, and Lt. \n     Col. Alexander Vindman, representing the National Security \n     Council. I arrived the evening before the inauguration and, \n     after attending a country briefing provided by U.S. embassy \n     staff the next morning, May 20, went to the inauguration, a \n     luncheon following the inauguration, and a delegation meeting \n     with Zelensky and his advisers.\n       The main purpose of my attendance was to demonstrate and \n     express my support and that of the U.S. Congress for Zelensky \n     and the people of Ukraine. In addition, the delegation \n     repeatedly stressed the importance of fulfilling the election \n     mandate to fight corruption, and also discussed the priority \n     of Ukraine obtaining sufficient inventories of gas prior to \n     winter.\n       Two specific points made during the meetings stand out in \n     my memory as being relevant.\n       The first occurred during the country briefing. I had just \n     finished making the point that supporting Ukraine was \n     essential because it was ground zero in our geopolitical \n     competition with Russia. I was surprised when Vindman \n     responded to my point. He stated that it was the position of \n     the NSC that our relationship with Ukraine should be kept \n     separate from our geopolitical competition with Russia. My \n     blunt response was, ``How in the world is that even \n     possible?''\n       I do not know if Vindman accurately stated the NSC's \n     position, whether President Trump shared that viewpoint, or \n     whether Vindman was really just expressing his own view. I \n     raise this point because I believe that a significant number \n     of bureaucrats and staff members within the executive branch \n     have never accepted President Trump as legitimate and resent \n     his unorthodox style and his intrusion onto their ``turf.'' \n     They react by leaking to the press and participating in the \n     ongoing effort to sabotage his policies and, if possible, \n     remove him from office. It is entirely possible that Vindman \n     fits this profile.\n       Quotes from the transcript of Vindman's opening remarks and \n     his deposition reinforce this point and deserve to be \n     highlighted. Vindman testified that an ``alternative \n     narrative'' pushed by the president's personal attorney, Rudy \n     Giuliani, was ``inconsistent with the consensus views of \n     the'' relevant federal agencies and was ``undermining the \n     consensus policy.''\n       Vindman's testimony, together with other witnesses' use of \n     similar terms such as ``our policy,'' ``stated policy,'' and \n     ``long-standing policy'' lend further credence to the point \n     I'm making. Whether you agree with President Trump or not, it \n     should be acknowledged that the Constitution vests the power \n     of conducting foreign policy with the duly elected president. \n     American foreign policy is what the president determines it \n     to be, not what the ``consensus'' of unelected foreign policy \n     bureaucrats wants it to be. If any bureaucrats disagree with \n     the president, they should use their powers of persuasion \n     within their legal chain of command to get the president to \n     agree with their viewpoint. In the end, if they are unable to \n     carry out the policy of the president, they should resign. \n     They should not seek to undermine the policy by leaking to \n     people outside their chain of command.\n       The other noteworthy recollection involves how Perry \n     conveyed the delegation concern over rumors that Zelensky was \n     going to appoint Andriy Bohdan, the lawyer for oligarch Igor \n     Kolomoisky, as his chief of staff. The delegation viewed \n     Bohdan's rumored appointment to be contrary to the goal of \n     fighting corruption and maintaining U.S. support. Without \n     naming ``Bohdan, Secretary Perry made U.S. concerns very \n     clear in his remarks to Zelensky.\n       Shortly thereafter, ignoring U.S. advice, Zelensky did \n     appoint Bohdan as his chief of staff. This was not viewed as \n     good news, but I gave my advice on how to publicly react in a \n     text to Sondland on May 22: ``Best case scenario on COS: \n     Right now Zelensky needs someone he can trust. I'm not a fan \n     of lawyers, but they do represent all kinds of people. Maybe \n     this guy is a patriot. He certainly understands the \n     corruption of the oligarchs. Could be the perfect guy to \n     advise Zelensky on how to deal with them. Zelensky knows why \n     he got elected For now, I think we express our concerns, but \n     give Zelensky the benefit of the doubt. Also let him know \n     everyone in the U.S. will be watching VERY closely.''\n       At the suggestion of Sondland, the delegation (Perry, \n     Volker, Sondland and me) proposed a meeting with President \n     Trump in the Oval Office. The purpose of the meeting was to \n     brief the president on what we learned at the inauguration, \n     and convey our impressions of Zelensky and the current \n     political climate in Ukraine. The delegation uniformly was \n     impressed with Zelensky, understood the difficult challenges \n     he faced, and went into the meeting hoping to obtain \n     President Trump's strong support for Zelensky and the people \n     of Ukraine. Our specific goals were to obtain a commitment \n     from President Trump to invite Zelensky to meet in the Oval \n     Office, to appoint a U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who would \n     have strong bipartisan support, and to have President Trump \n     publicly voice his support.\n       Our Oval Office meeting took place on May 23. The four \n     members of the delegation sat lined up in front of President \n     Trump's desk. Because we were all directly facing the \n     president, I do not know who else was in attendance sitting \n     or standing behind us. I can't speak for the others, but I \n     was very surprised by President Trump's reaction to our \n     report and requests.\n       He expressed strong reservations about supporting Ukraine. \n     He made it crystal clear that he viewed Ukraine as a \n     thoroughly corrupt country both generally and, specifically, \n     regarding rumored meddling in the 2016 election. Volker \n     summed up this attitude in his testimony by quoting the \n     president as saying, ``They are all corrupt. They are all \n     terrible people. . . . I don't want to spend any time with \n     that.'' I do not recall President Trump ever explicitly \n     mentioning the names Burisma or Biden, but it was obvious he \n     was aware of rumors that corrupt actors in Ukraine might have \n     played a part in helping create the false Russia collusion \n     narrative.\n       Of the four-person delegation, I was the only one who did \n     not work for the president. As a result, I was in a better \n     position to push back on the president's viewpoint and \n     attempt to persuade him to change it. I acknowledged that he \n     was correct regarding endemic corruption. I said that we \n     weren't asking him to support corrupt oligarchs and \n     politicians but to support the Ukrainian people who had given \n     Zelensky a strong mandate to fight corruption. I also made \n     the point that he and Zelensky had much in common. Both were \n     complete outsiders who face strong resistance from entrenched \n     interests both within and outside government. Zelensky would \n     need much help in fulfilling his mandate, and America's \n     support was crucial.\n       It was obvious that his viewpoint and reservations were \n     strongly held, and that we would have a significant sales job \n     ahead of us getting him to change his mind. I specifically \n     asked him to keep his viewpoint and reservations private and \n     not to express them publicly until he had a chance to meet \n     Zelensky. He agreed to do so, but he also added that he \n     wanted Zelensky to know exactly how he felt about the \n     corruption in Ukraine prior to any future meeting. I used \n     that directive in my Sept. 5 meeting with Zelensky in \n     Ukraine.\n       One final point regarding the May 23 meeting: I am aware \n     that Sondland has testified that President Trump also \n     directed the delegation to work with Rudy Giuliani. I have no \n     recollection of the president saying that during the meeting. \n     It is entirely possible he did, but because I do not work for \n     the president, if made, that comment simply did not register \n     with me. I also remember Sondland staying behind to talk to \n     the president as the rest of the delegation left the Oval \n     Office.\n       I continued to meet in my Senate office with \n     representatives from Ukraine: on June\n\n\n     13 with members of the Ukrainian Parliament's Foreign Affairs \n     Committee; on July 11 with Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S. \n     and secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense \n     Council, Oleksandr Danyliuk; and again on July 31 with \n     Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., Valeriy Chaly. At no time \n     during those meetings did anyone from Ukraine raise the issue \n     of the withholding of military aid or express concerns \n     regarding pressure being applied by the president or his \n     administration.\n       During Congress' August recess, my staff worked with the \n     State Department and others in the administration to plan a \n     trip to Europe during the week of Sept. 2 with Senator Murphy \n     to include Russia, Serbia, Kosovo and Ukraine. On or around \n     Aug. 26, we were informed that our requests for visas into \n     Russia were denied. On either Aug. 28 or 29, I became aware \n     of the fact that $250 million of military aid was being \n     withheld. This news would obviously impact my trip and \n     discussions with Zelensky.\n       Sondland had texted me on Aug. 26 remarking on the Russian \n     visa denial. I replied on Aug. 30, apologizing for my tardy \n     response and requesting a call to discuss Ukraine. We \n     scheduled a call for sometime between 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 \n     p.m. that same day. I called Sondland and asked what he knew \n     about the hold on military support. I did not memorialize the \n     conversation in any way, and my memory of exactly what \n     Sondland told me is far from perfect. I was hoping that his \n     testimony before the House would help jog my memory, but he \n     seems to have an even fuzzier recollection of that call than \n     I do.\n       The most salient point of the call involved Sondland \n     describing an arrangement where, if Ukraine did something to \n     demonstrate its serious intention to fight corruption and \n     possibly help determine what involvement operatives in \n     Ukraine might have had during the 2016 U.S. presidential \n     campaign, then Trump would release the hold on military \n     support.\n       I have stated that I winced when that arrangement was \n     described to me. I felt U.S. support for Ukraine was \n     essential, particularly with Zelensky's new and inexperienced \n     administration facing an aggressive Vladimir Putin. I feared \n     any sign of reduced U.S. support could prompt Putin to \n     demonstrate even more aggression, and because I was convinced \n     Zelensky was sincere in his desire to fight corruption, this \n     was no time to be withholding aid for any reason. It was the \n     time to show maximum strength and resolve.\n       I next put in a call request for National Security Adviser \n     John Bolton, and spoke with him on Aug. 31. I believe he \n     greed with my position on providing military assistance, and \n     he suggested I speak with both the vice president and \n     president. I requested calls with both, but was not able to \n     schedule a call with Vice President Pence. President Trump \n     called me that same day.\n       The purpose of the call was to inform President Trump of my \n     upcoming trip to Ukraine and to try to persuade him to \n     authorize me to tell Zelensky that the hold would be lifted \n     on military aid. The president was not prepared to lift the \n     hold, and he was consistent in the reasons he cited. He \n     reminded me how thoroughly corrupt Ukraine was and again \n     conveyed his frustration that Europe doesn't do its fair \n     share of providing military aid. He specifically cited the \n     sort of conversation he would have with Angela Merkel, \n     chancellor of Germany. To paraphrase President Trump: ``Ron, \n     I talk to Angela and ask her, `Why don't you fund these \n     things,' and she tells me, `Because we know you will.' We're \n     schmucks. Ron. We're schmucks.''\n       I acknowledged the corruption in Ukraine, and I did not \n     dispute the fact that Europe could and should provide more \n     military support. But I pointed out that Germany was opposed \n     to providing Ukraine lethal defensive weaponry and simply \n     would not do so. As a result, if we wanted to deter Russia \n     from further aggression, it was up to the U.S. to provide it.\n       I had two additional counterarguments. First, I wasn't \n     suggesting we support the oligarchs and other corrupt \n     Ukrainians. Our support would be for the courageous \n     Ukrainians who had overthrown Putin's puppet, Viktor \n     Yanukovich, and delivered a remarkable 73% mandate in \n     electing Zelensky to fight corruption. Second, I argued that \n     withholding the support looked horrible politically in that \n     it could be used to bolster the ``Trump is soft on Russia'' \n     mantra.\n       It was only after he reiterated his reasons for not giving \n     me the authority to tell Zelensky the support would be \n     released that I asked him about whether there was some kind \n     of arrangement where Ukraine would take some action and the \n     hold would be lifted. Without hesitation, President Trump \n     immediately denied such an arrangement existed. As reported \n     in the Wall Street Journal, I quoted the president as saying, \n     ``(Expletive deleted)--No way. I would never do that. Who \n     told you that?'' I have accurately characterized his reaction \n     as adamant, vehement and angry--there was more than one \n     expletive that I have deleted.\n       Based on his reaction, I felt more than a little guilty \n     even asking him the question, much less telling him I heard \n     it from Sondland. He seemed even more annoyed by that, and \n     asked me, ``Who is that guy''? I interpreted that not as a \n     literal question--the president did know whom Sondland was--\n     but rather as a sign that the president did not know him \n     well. I replied by saying, ``I thought he was your buddy from \n     the real estate business.'' The president replied by saying \n     he barely knew him.\n       After discussing Ukraine, we talked about other unrelated \n     matters. Finally, the president said he had to go because he \n     had a hurricane to deal with. He wrapped up the conversation \n     referring back to my request to release the hold on military \n     support for Ukraine by saying something like, ``Ron, I \n     understand your position. We're reviewing it now, and you'll \n     probably like my final decision.''\n       On Tuesday, Sept. 3, I had a short follow up call with \n     Bolton to discuss my upcoming trip to Ukraine, Serbia and \n     Kosovo. I do not recall discussing anything in particular \n     that relates to the current impeachment inquiry on that call.\n       We arrived in Kyiv on Sept. 4, joining Taylor and Murphy \n     for a full day of meetings on Sept. 5 with embassy staff, \n     members of the new Ukrainian administration, and Zelensky, \n     who was accompanied by some of his top advisers. We also \n     attended the opening proceedings of the Ukrainian High Anti-\n     Corruption Court. The meetings reinforced our belief that \n     Zelensky and his team were serious about fulfilling his \n     mandate--to paraphrase the way he described it in his speech \n     at the High Anti-Corruption Court--to not only fight \n     corruption but to defeat it.\n       The meeting with Zelensky started with him requesting we \n     dispense with the usual diplomatic opening and get right to \n     the issue on everyone's mind, the hold being placed on \n     military support.\n       He asked if any of us knew the current status. Because I \n     had just spoken to President Trump, I fielded his question \n     and conveyed the two reasons the president told me for his \n     hold. I explained that I had tried to persuade the president \n     to authorize me to announce the hold was released but that I \n     was unsuccessful.\n       As much as Zelensky was concerned about losing the military \n     aid, he was even more concerned about the signal that would \n     send. I shared his concern. I suggested that in our public \n     statements we first emphasize the universal support that the \n     U.S. Congress has shown--and will continue to show--for the \n     Ukrainian people. Second, we should minimize the significance \n     of the hold on military aid as simply a timing issue coming a \n     few weeks before the end of our federal fiscal year. Even if \n     President Trump and the deficit hawks within his \n     administration decided not to obligate funding for the \n     current fiscal year, Congress would make sure he had no \n     option in the next fiscal year--which then was only a few \n     weeks away. I also made the point that Murphy was on the \n     Appropriations Committee and could lead the charge on \n     funding.\n       Murphy made the additional point that one of the most \n     valuable assets Ukraine possesses is bipartisan congressional \n     support. He warned Zelensky not to respond to requests from \n     American political actors or he would risk losing Ukraine's \n     bipartisan support. I did not comment on this issue that \n     Murphy raised.\n       Instead, I began discussing a possible meeting with \n     President Trump. I viewed a meeting between the two \n     presidents as crucial for overcoming President Trump's \n     reservations and securing full U.S. support. It was at this \n     point that President Trump's May 23 directive came into play.\n       I prefaced my comment to Zelensky by saying, ``Let me go \n     out on a limb here. Are you or any of your advisers aware of \n     the inaugural delegation's May 23 meeting in the Oval Office \n     following your inauguration?'' No one admitted they were, so \n     I pressed on. ``The reason I bring up that meeting is that I \n     don't want you caught off-guard if President Trump reacts to \n     you the same way he reacted to the delegation's request for \n     support for Ukraine.''\n       I told the group that President Trump explicitly told the \n     delegation that he wanted to make sure Zelensky knew exactly \n     how he felt about Ukraine before any meeting took place. To \n     repeat Volker's quote of President Trump: ``They are all \n     corrupt. They are all terrible people. . . . I don't want to \n     spend any time with that.'' That was the general attitude \n     toward Ukraine that I felt President Trump directed us to \n     convey. Since I did not have Volker's quote to use at the \n     time, I tried to portray that strongly held attitude and \n     reiterated the reasons President Trump consistently gave me \n     for his reservations regarding Ukraine: endemic corruption \n     and inadequate European support.\n       I also conveyed the counterarguments I used \n     (unsuccessfully) to persuade the president to lift his hold: \n     (1) We would be supporting the people of Ukraine, not corrupt \n     oligarchs, and (2) withholding military support was not \n     politically smart. Although I recognized how this next point \n     would be problematic, I also suggested any public statement \n     Zelensky could make asking for greater support from Europe \n     would probably be viewed favorably by President Trump.\n       Finally, I commented on how excellent Zelensky's English \n     was and encouraged him to use English as much as possible in \n     a future meeting with President Trump. With a smile on his \n     face, he replied, ``But Senator Johnson, you don't realize \n     how beautiful my Ukrainian is.'' I jokingly conceded the \n     point by saying I was not able to distinguish his Ukrainian \n     from his Russian.\n       This was a very open, frank, and supportive discussion. \n     There was no reason for\n\n\n     anyone on either side not to be completely honest or to \n     withhold any concerns. At no time during this meeting--or any \n     other meeting on this trip--was there any mention by Zelensky \n     or any Ukrainian that they were feeling pressure to do \n     anything in return for the military aid, not even after \n     Murphy warned them about getting involved in the 2020 \n     election--which would have been the perfect time to discuss \n     any pressure.\n       Following the meeting with Zelensky and his advisers, \n     Murphy and I met with the Ukrainian press outside the \n     presidential office building. Our primary message was that we \n     were in Kyiv to demonstrate our strong bipartisan support for \n     the people of Ukraine. We were very encouraged by our \n     meetings with Zelensky and other members of his new \n     government in their commitment to fulfill their electoral \n     mandate to fight and defeat corruption. When the issue of \n     military support was raised, I provided the response I \n     suggested above: I described it as a timing issue at the end \n     of a fiscal year and said that, regardless of what decision \n     President Trump made on the fiscal year 2019 funding, I was \n     confident Congress would restore the funding in fiscal year \n     2020. In other words: Don't mistake a budget issue for a \n     change in America's strong support for the people of Ukraine.\n       Congress came back into session on Sept. 9. During a vote \n     early in the week, I approached one of the co-chairs of the \n     Senate Ukraine Caucus, U.S. Sen. Richard Durbin. I briefly \n     described our trip to Ukraine and the concerns Zelensky and \n     his advisers had over the hold on military support. According \n     to press reports, Senator Durbin stated that was the first \n     time he was made aware of the hold. I went on to describe how \n     I tried to minimize the impact of that hold by assuring \n     Ukrainians that Congress could restore the funding in fiscal \n     year 2020. I encouraged Durbin, as I had encouraged Murphy, \n     to use his membership on the Senate Appropriations Committee \n     to restore the funding.\n       Also according to a press report, leading up to a Sept. 12 \n     defense appropriation committee markup, Durbin offered an \n     amendment to restore funding. On Sept. 11, the administration \n     announced that the hold had been lifted. I think it is \n     important to note the hold was lifted only 14 days after its \n     existence became publicly known, and 55 days after the hold \n     apparently had been placed.\n       On Friday, Oct. 4, I saw news reports of text messages that \n     Volker had supplied the House of Representatives as part of \n     his testimony. The texts discussed a possible press release \n     that Zelensky might issue to help persuade President Trump to \n     offer an Oval Office meeting. Up to that point, I had \n     publicly disclosed only the first part of my Aug. 31 phone \n     call with President Trump, where I lobbied him to release the \n     military aid and he provided his consistent reasons for not \n     doing so: corruption and inadequate European support.\n       Earlier in the week, I had given a phone interview with \n     Siobhan Hughes of the Wall Street Journal regarding my \n     involvement with Ukraine. With the disclosure of the Volker \n     texts, I felt it was important to go on the record with the \n     next part of my Aug. 31 call with President Trump: his \n     denial. I had not previously disclosed this because I could \n     not precisely recall what Sondland had told me on Aug. 30, \n     and what I had conveyed to President Trump, regarding action \n     Ukraine would take before military aid would be released. To \n     the best of my recollection, the action described by Sondland \n     on Aug. 30 involved a demonstration that the new Ukrainian \n     government was serious about fighting corruption--something \n     like the appointment of a prosecutor general with high \n     integrity.\n       I called Hughes Friday morning, Oct. 4, to update my \n     interview. It was a relatively lengthy interview, almost 30 \n     minutes, as I attempted to put a rather complex set of events \n     into context. Toward the tail end of that interview, Hughes \n     said, ``It almost sounds like, the way you see it, Gordon was \n     kind of freelancing and he took it upon himself to do \n     something that the president hadn't exactly blessed, as you \n     see it.'' I replied, ``That's a possibility, but I don't know \n     that. Let's face it: The president can't have his fingers in \n     everything. He can't be stage-managing everything, so you \n     have members of his administration trying to create good \n     policy.''\n       To my knowledge, most members of the administration and \n     Congress dealing with the issues involving Ukraine disagreed \n     with President Trump's attitude and approach toward Ukraine. \n     Many who had the opportunity and ability to influence the \n     president attempted to change his mind. I see nothing wrong \n     with U.S. officials working with Ukrainian officials to \n     demonstrate Ukraine's commitment to reform in order to change \n     President Trump's attitude and gain his support.\n       Nor is it wrong for administration staff to use their \n     powers of persuasion within their chain of command to \n     influence policy. What is wrong is for people who work for, \n     and at the pleasure of, the president to believe they set \n     U.S. foreign policy instead of the duly elected president \n     doing so. It also would be wrong for those individuals to \n     step outside their chain of command--or established \n     whistleblower procedures--to undermine the president's \n     policy. If those working for the president don't feel they \n     can implement the president's policies in good conscience, \n     they should follow Gen. James Mattis' example and resign. If \n     they choose to do so, they can then take their disagreements \n     to the public. That would be the proper and high-integrity \n     course of action.\n       This impeachment effort has done a great deal of damage to \n     our democracy. The release of transcripts of discussions \n     between the president of the United States and another world \n     leader sets a terrible precedent that will deter and limit \n     candid conversations between the president and world leaders \n     from now on. The weakening of executive privilege will also \n     limit the extent to which presidential advisers will feel \n     comfortable providing ``out of the box'' and other frank \n     counsel in the future.\n       In my role as chairman of the Senate's primary oversight \n     committee, I strongly believe in and support whistleblower \n     protections. But in that role, I am also aware that not all \n     whistleblowers are created equal. Not every whistleblower has \n     purely altruistic motives. Some have personal axes to grind \n     against a superior or co-workers. Others might have a \n     political ax to grind.\n       The Intelligence Community Inspector General acknowledges \n     the whistleblower in this instance exhibits some measure of \n     ``an arguable political bias.'' The whistleblower' s \n     selection of attorney Mark Zaid lends credence to the ICIG's \n     assessment, given Zaid's tweet that mentions coup, rebellion \n     and impeachment only 10 days after Trump's inauguration.\n       If the whistleblower's intention was to improve and \n     solidify the relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine, he or \n     she failed miserably. Instead, the result has been to \n     publicize and highlight the president's deeply held \n     reservations toward Ukraine that the whistleblower felt were \n     so damaging to our relationship with Ukraine and to U.S. \n     national security. The dispute over policy was being resolved \n     between the two branches of government before the \n     whistleblower complaint was made public. All the complaint \n     has accomplished is to fuel the House's impeachment desire \n     (which I believe was the real motivation), and damage our \n     democracy as described above.\n       America faces enormous challenges at home and abroad. My \n     oversight efforts have persuaded me there has been a \n     concerted effort, probably beginning the day after the \n     November 2016 election, to sabotage and undermine President \n     Trump and his administration. President Trump, his \n     supporters, and the American public have a legitimate and \n     understandable desire to know if wrongdoing occurred directed \n     toward influencing the 2016 election or sabotaging Trump's \n     administration. The American public also has a right to know \n     if no wrongdoing occurred. The sooner we get answers to the \n     many unanswered questions, the sooner we can attempt to heal \n     our severely divided nation and turn our attention to the \n     many daunting challenges America faces.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Ron Johnson,\n     United States Senator.", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 95}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker": "None", "text": "                                  ____\n\n\n             [From RealClearInvestigations, Jan. 22, 2019]\n\n Whistleblower Was Overheard in '17 Discussing With Ally How To Remove \n                                 Trump\n\n                            (By Paul Sperry)\n\n       Barely two weeks after Donald Trump took office, Eric \n     Ciaramella--the CIA analyst whose name was recently linked in \n     a tweet by the president and mentioned by lawmakers as the \n     anonymous ``whistleblower'' who touched off Trump's \n     impeachment--was overheard in the White House discussing with \n     another staffer how to remove the newly elected president \n     from office, according to former colleagues.\n       Sources told RealClearInvestigations the staffer with whom \n     Ciaramella was speaking was Sean Misko. Both were Obama \n     administration holdovers working in the Trump White House on \n     foreign policy and national security issues. And both \n     expressed anger over Trump's new ``America First'' foreign \n     policy, a sea change from President Obama's approach to \n     international affairs.\n       ``Just days after he was sworn in they were already talking \n     about trying to get rid of him,'' said a White House \n     colleague who overheard their conversation.\n       ``They weren't just bent on subverting his agenda,'' the \n     former official added. ``They were plotting to actually have \n     him removed from office.''\n       Misko left the White House last summer to join House \n     impeachment manager Adam Schiff's committee, where sources \n     say he offered ``guidance'' to the whistleblower, who has \n     been officially identified only as an intelligence officer in \n     a complaint against Trump filed under whistleblower laws. \n     Misko then helped run the impeachment inquiry based on that \n     complaint as a top investigator for congressional Democrats.\n       The probe culminated in Trump's impeachment last month on a \n     party-line vote in the House of Representatives. Schiff and \n     other House Democrats last week delivered the articles of \n     impeachment to the Senate, and are now pressing the case for \n     his removal during the trial, which began Tuesday.\n       The coordination between the official believed to be the \n     whistleblower and a key Democratic staffer, details of which \n     are disclosed here for the first time, undercuts the \n     narrative that impeachment developed spontaneously out of the \n     ``patriotism'' of an ``apolitical civil servant.''\n       Two former co-workers said they overheard Ciaramella and \n     Misko, dose friends and Democrats held over from the Obama \n     administration, discussing how to ``take out,'' or remove, \n     the new president from office within days of Trump's \n     inauguration. These co-workers said the president's \n     controversial Ukraine phone call in July 2019 provided the\n\n\n     pretext they and their Democratic allies had been looking \n     for.\n       ``They didn't like his policies,'' another former White \n     House official said. ``They had a political vendetta against \n     him from Day One.''\n       Their efforts were part of a larger pattern of coordination \n     to build a case for impeachment, involving Democratic leaders \n     as well as anti-Trump figures both inside and outside of \n     government.\n       All unnamed sources for this article spoke only on \n     condition that they not be further identified or described. \n     Although strong evidence points to Ciaramella as the \n     government employee who lodged the whistleblower complaint, \n     he has not been officially identified as such. As a result, \n     this article makes a distinction between public information \n     released about the unnamed whistleblower/CIA analyst and \n     specific information about Ciaramella.\n       Democrats based their impeachment case on the whistleblower \n     complaint, which alleges that President Trump sought to help \n     his re-election campaign by demanding that Ukraine's leader \n     investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son \n     Hunter in exchange for military aid. Yet Schiff, who heads \n     the House Intelligence Committee, and other Democrats have \n     insisted on keeping the identity of the whistleblower secret, \n     citing concern for his safety, while arguing that his \n     testimony no longer matters because other witnesses and \n     documents have ``corroborated'' what he alleged in his \n     complaint about the Ukraine call.\n       Republicans have fought unsuccessfully to call him as a \n     witness, arguing that his motivations and associations are \n     relevant--and that the president has the same due-process \n     right to confront his accuser as any other American.\n       The whistleblower's candor is also being called into \n     question. It turns out that the CIA operative failed to \n     report his contacts with Schiff's office to the intelligence \n     community's inspector general who fielded his whistleblower \n     complaint. He withheld the information both in interviews \n     with the inspector general, Michael Atkinson, and in writing, \n     according to impeachment committee investigators. The \n     whistleblower form he filled out required him to disclose \n     whether he had ``contacted other entities''--including \n     ``members of Congress.'' But he left that section blank on \n     the disclosure form he signed.\n       The investigators say that details about how the \n     whistleblower consulted with Schiff's staff and perhaps \n     misled Atkinson about those interactions are contained in the \n     transcript of a closed-door briefing Atkinson gave to the \n     House Intelligence Committee last October. However, Schiff \n     has sealed the transcript from public view. It is the only \n     impeachment witness transcript out of 18 that he has not \n     released.\n       Schiff has classified the document ``Secret,'' preventing \n     Republicans who attended the Atkinson briefing from quoting \n     from it. Even impeachment investigators cannot view it \n     outside a highly secured room, known as a ``SCIF,'' in the \n     basement of the Capitol. Members must first get permission \n     from Schiff, and they are forbidden from bringing phones into \n     the SCIF or from taking notes from the document.\n       While the identity of the whistleblower remains \n     unconfirmed, at least officially, Trump recently retweeted a \n     message naming Ciaramella, while Republican Sen. Rand Paul \n     and Rep. Louie Gohmert of the House Judiciary Committee have \n     publicly demanded that Ciaramella testify about his role in \n     the whistleblower complaint.\n       During last year's closed-door House depositions of \n     impeachment witnesses, Ciaramella's name was invoked in \n     heated discussions about the whistleblower, as \n     RealClearInvestigations first reported Oct. 30, and has \n     appeared in at least one testimony transcript. Congressional \n     Republicans complain Schiff and his staff counsel have \n     redacted his name from other documents.\n       Lawyers representing the whistleblower have neither \n     confirmed nor denied that Ciaramella is their client. In \n     November, after Donald Trump Jr. named Ciaramella and cited \n     RCI's story in a series of tweets, however, they sent a \n     ``cease and desist'' letter to the White House demanding \n     Trump and his ``surrogates'' stop ``attacking'' him. And just \n     as the whistleblower complaint was made public in September, \n     Ciaramella's social media postings and profiles were scrubbed \n     from the Internet.\n\n\n                        `Take Out' the President\n\n       An Obama holdover and registered Democrat, Ciaramella in \n     early 2017 expressed hostility toward the newly elected \n     president during White House meetings, his co-workers said in \n     interviews with RealClearInvestigations. They added that \n     Ciaramella sought to have Trump removed from office long \n     before the filing of the whistleblower complaint.\n       At the time, the CIA operative worked on loan to the White \n     House as a top Ukrainian analyst in the National Security \n     Council, where he had previously served as an adviser on \n     Ukraine to Vice President Biden. The whistleblower complaint \n     cites Biden, alleging that Trump demanded Ukraine's newly \n     elected leader investigate him and his son ``to help the \n     president's 2020 reelection bid.''\n       Two NSC co-workers told RCI that they overheard Ciaramella \n     and Misko--who was also working at the NSC as an analyst--\n     making anti-Trump remarks to each other while attending a \n     staff-wide NSC meeting called by then-National Security \n     Adviser Michael Flynn, where they sat together in the south \n     auditorium of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, part \n     of the White House complex.\n       The ``all hands'' meeting, held about two weeks into the \n     new administration, was attended by hundreds of NSC \n     employees.\n       ``They were popping off about how they were going to remove \n     Trump from office. No joke,'' said one ex-colleague, who \n     spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive \n     matters.\n       A military staffer detailed to the NSC, who was seated \n     directly in front of Ciaramella and Misko during the meeting, \n     confirmed hearing them talk about toppling Trump during their \n     private conversation, which the source said lasted about one \n     minute. The crowd was preparing to get up to leave the room \n     at the time.\n       ``After Flynn briefed [the staff] about what `America \n     first' foreign policy means, Ciaramella turned to Misko and \n     commented, 'We need to take him out,' '' the staffer \n     recalled. ``And Misko replied, `Yeah, we need to do \n     everything we can to take out the president.' ''\n       Added the military detailee, who spoke on condition of \n     anonymity: ``By `taking him out,' they meant removing him \n     from office by any means necessary. They were triggered by \n     Trump's and Flynn's vision for the world. This was the first \n     `all hands' [staff meeting] where they got to see Trump's \n     national security team, and they were huffing and puffing \n     throughout the briefing any time Flynn said something they \n     didn't like about `America First.' ''\n       He said he also overheard Ciaramella telling Misko, \n     referring to Trump, `We can't let him enact this foreign \n     policy.' ''\n       Alarmed by their conversation, the military staffer \n     immediately reported what he heard to his superiors.\n       ``It was so shocking that they were so blatant and \n     outspoken about their opinion,'' he recalled. ``They weren't \n     shouting it, but they didn't seem to feel the need to hide \n     it.''\n       The co-workers didn't think much more about the incident.\n       ``We just thought they were wacky,'' the first source said. \n     ``Little did we know.''\n       Neither Ciaramella nor Misko could be reached for comment.\n       A CIA alumnus, Misko had previously assisted Biden's top \n     national security aide Jake Sullivan. Former NSC staffers \n     said Misko was Ciaramella's closest and most trusted ally in \n     the Trump White House.\n       ``Eric and Sean were very tight and spent nearly two years \n     together at the NSC,'' said a former supervisor who requested \n     anonymity. ``Both of them were paranoid about Trump.''\n       ``They were thick as thieves,'' added the first NSC source. \n     ``They sat next to each other and complained about Trump all \n     the time. They were buddies. They weren't just colleagues. \n     They were buddies outside the White House.''\n       The February 2017 incident wasn't the only time the pair \n     exhibited open hostility toward the president. During the \n     following months, both were accused internally of leaking \n     negative information about Trump to the media.\n       But Trump's controversial call to the new president of \n     Ukraine this past summer--in which he asked the foreign \n     leader for help with domestic investigations involving the \n     Obama administration, including Biden--gave them the opening \n     they were looking for.\n       A mutual ally in the National Security Council who was one \n     of the White House officials authorized to listen in on \n     Trump's July 25 conversation with Ukraine's president leaked \n     it to Ciaramella the next day--July 26--according to former \n     NSC co-workers and congressional sources. The friend, \n     Ukraine-born Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, held Ciaramella's \n     old position at the NSC as director for Ukraine. Although \n     Ciaramella had left the White House to return to the CIA in \n     mid-2017, the two officials continued to collaborate through \n     interagency meetings.\n       Vindman leaked what he'd heard to Ciaramella by phone that \n     afternoon, the sources said. In their conversation, which \n     lasted a few minutes, he described Trump's call as ``crazy,'' \n     and speculated he had ``committed a criminal act.'' Neither \n     reviewed the transcript of the call before the White House \n     released it months later.\n       NSC co-workers said that Vindman, like Ciaramella, openly \n     expressed his disdain for Trump whose foreign policy was \n     often at odds with the recommendations of ``the \n     interagency''--a network of agency working groups comprised \n     of intelligence bureaucrats, experts and diplomats who \n     regularly meet to craft and coordinate policy positions \n     inside the federal government.\n       Before he was detailed to the White House, Vindman served \n     in the U.S. Army, where he once received a reprimand from a \n     superior officer for badmouthing and ridiculing America in \n     front of Russian soldiers his unit was training with during a \n     joint 2012 exercise in Germany.\n       His commanding officer, Army Lt. Col. Jim Hickman, \n     complained that Vindman, then a major, ``was apologetic of \n     American culture, laughed about Americans not being educated \n     or worldly and really talked up Obama and globalism to the \n     point of [It being] uncomfortable.''\n       ``Vindman was a partisan Democrat at least as far back as \n     2012,'' Hickman, now retired, asserted. ``Do not let the \n     uniform fool you. He is a political activist in uniform.''\n       Attempts to reach Vindman through his lawyer were \n     unsuccessful.\n\n\n       July 26 was also the day that Schiff hired Misko to head up \n     the investigation of Trump, congressional employment records \n     show. Misko, in turn, secretly huddled with the whistleblower \n     prior to filing his Aug. 12 complaint, according to multiple \n     congressional sources, and shared what he told him with \n     Schiff, who initially denied the contacts before press \n     accounts revealed them.\n       Schiff's office has also denied helping the whistleblower \n     prepare his complaint, while rejecting a Republican subpoena \n     for documents relating to it. But Capitol Hill veterans and \n     federal whistleblower experts are suspicious of that account.\n       Fred Fleitz, who fielded a number of whistleblower \n     complaints from the intelligence community as a former senior \n     House Intelligence Committee staff member, said it was \n     obvious that the CIA analyst had received coaching in writing \n     the nine-page whistleblower report.\n       ``From my experience, such an extremely polished \n     whistleblowing complaint is unheard of,'' Fleitz, also a \n     former CIA analyst, said. ``He appears to have collaborated \n     in drafting his complaint with partisan House Intelligence \n     Committee members and staff.''\n       Fleitz, who recently served as chief of staff to former \n     National Security Adviser John Bolton, said the complaint \n     appears to have been tailored to buttress an impeachment \n     charge of soliciting the ``interference'' of a foreign \n     government in the election.\n       And the whistleblower's unsupported allegation became the \n     foundation for Democrats' first article of impeachment \n     against the president. It even adopts the language used by \n     the CIA analyst in his complaint, which Fleitz said reads \n     more like ``a political document.''\n\n\n                              Outside Help\n\n       After providing the outlines of his complaint to Schiff's \n     staff, the CIA analyst was referred to whistleblower attorney \n     Andrew Bakaj by a mutual friend ``who is an attorney and \n     expert in national security law,'' according to the \n     Washington Post, which did not identify the go-between.\n       A former CIA officer, Bakaj had worked with Ciaramella at \n     the spy agency. They have even more in common: like the 33-\n     year-old Ciaramella, the 37-year-old Bakaj is a Connecticut \n     native who has spent time in Ukraine. He's also contributed \n     money to Biden's presidential campaign and once worked for \n     former Sen. Hillary Clinton. He's also briefed the \n     intelligence panel Schiff chairs.\n       Bakaj brought in another whistleblower lawyer, Mark Zaid, \n     to help on the case. A Democratic donor and a politically \n     active anti-Trump advocate, Zaid was willing to help \n     represent the CIA analyst. On Jan. 30, 2017, around the same \n     time former colleagues say they overheard Ciaramella and \n     Misko conspiring to take Trump out, Zaid tweeted that a \n     ``coup has started'' and that ``impeachment will follow \n     ultimately.''\n       Neither Bakaj nor Zaid responded to requests for an \n     interview.\n       It's not clear who the mutual friend and national security \n     attorney was whom the analyst turned to for additional help \n     after meeting with Schiff's staff. But people familiar with \n     the matter say that former Justice Department national \n     security lawyer David Laufman involved himself early on in \n     the whistleblower case.\n       Also a former CIA officer, Laufman was promoted by the \n     Obama administration to run counterintelligence cases, \n     including the high-profile investigations of Clinton's \n     classified emails and the Trump campaign's alleged ties to \n     Russia. Laufman sat in on Clinton's July 2016 FBI interview. \n     He also signed off on the wiretapping of a Trump campaign \n     adviser, which the Department of Justice inspector general \n     determined was conducted under false pretenses involving \n     doctored emails, suppression of exculpatory evidence, and \n     other malfeasance. Laufman's office was implicated in a \n     report detailing the surveillance misconduct.\n       Laufman could not be reached for comment.\n       Laufman and Zaid are old friends who have worked together \n     on legal matters in the past. ``I would not hesitate to join \n     forces with him on complicated cases,'' Zaid said of Laufman \n     in a recommendation posted on his LinkedIn page.\n       Laufman recently defended Zaid on Twitter after Trump \n     blasted Zaid for advocating a ``coup'' against him. ``These \n     attacks on Mark Zaid's patriotism are baseless, irresponsible \n     and dangerous,'' Laufman tweeted. ``Mark is an ardent \n     advocate for his clients.''\n       After the CIA analyst was coached on how to file a \n     complaint under Intelligence Community whistleblower \n     protections, he was steered to another Obama holdover--former \n     Justice Department attorney-turned-inspector general Michael \n     Atkinson, who facilitated the processing of his complaint, \n     despite numerous red flags raised by career Justice \n     Department lawyers who reviewed it.\n       The department's Office of Legal Counsel that the complaint \n     involved ``foreign diplomacy,'' not intelligence, contained \n     ``hearsay'' evidence based on ``secondhand'' information, and \n     did not meet the definition of an ``urgent concern'' that \n     needed to be reported to Congress. Still, Atkinson worked \n     closely with Schiff to pressure the White House to make the \n     complaint public.\n       Fleitz said cloaking the CIA analyst in the whistleblower \n     statute provided him cover from public scrutiny. By making \n     him anonymous, he was able to hide his background and \n     motives. Filing the complaint with the IC inspector general, \n     moreover, gave him added protections against reprisals, while \n     letting him disclose classified information. If he had filed \n     directly with Congress, it could not have made the complaint \n     public due to classified concerns. But a complaint referred \n     by the IG to Congress gave it more latitude over what it \n     could make public.\n\n\n                      Omitted Contacts With Schiff\n\n       The whistleblower complaint was publicly released Sept. 26 \n     after a barrage of letters and a subpoena from Schiff, along \n     with a flood of leaks to the media.\n       However, the whistleblower did not disclose to Atkinson \n     that he had briefed Schiff's office about his complaint \n     before filing it with the inspector general. He was required \n     on forms to list any other agencies he had contacted, \n     including Congress. But he omitted those contacts and other \n     material facts from his disclosure. He also appears to have \n     misled Atkinson on Aug. 12, when on a separate form he \n     stated: ``I reserve the option to exercise my legal right to \n     contact the committees directly,'' when he had already \n     contacted Schiff's committee weeks prior to making the \n     statement.\n       ``The whistleblower made statements to the inspector \n     general under the penalty of perjury that were not true or \n     correct,'' said Rep. John Ratcliffe, a Republican member of \n     the House Intelligence Committee.\n       Ratcliffe said Atkinson appeared unconcerned after the New \n     York Times revealed in early October that Schiff's office had \n     privately consulted with the CIA analyst before he filed his \n     complaint, contradicting Schiff's initial denials. Ratcliffe \n     told RealClearlnvestigations that in closed door testimony on \n     Oct. 4, ``I asked IG Atkinson about his `investigation' into \n     the contacts between Schiff's staff and the person who later \n     became the whistleblower.'' But he said Atkinson claimed that \n     he had not investigated them because he had only just learned \n     about them in the media.\n       On Oct. 8, after more media reports revealed the whistle \n     blower and Schiff's staff had concealed their contacts with \n     each other, the whistleblower called Atkinson's office to try \n     to explain why he made false statements in writing and \n     verbally, transgressions that could be punishable with a fine \n     of up to $10,000, imprisonment for up five years, or both, \n     according to the federal form he signed under penalty of \n     perjury.\n       In his clarification to the inspector general, the \n     whistleblower acknowledged for the first time reaching out to \n     Schiff's staff before filing the complaint, according to an \n     investigative report filed later that month by Atkinson.\n       ``The whistleblower got caught,'' Ratcliffe said. ``The \n     whistleblower made false statements. The whistleblower got \n     caught with Chairman Schiff.''\n       He says the truth about what happened is documented on \n     pages 53-73 of the transcript of Atkinson's eight-hour \n     testimony. Except that Schiff refuses to release it.\n       ``The transcript is classified `Secret' so Schiff can \n     prevent you from seeing the answers to my questions,'' \n     Ratcliffe told RCI.\n       Atkinson replaced Charles McCullough as the intelligence \n     community's IG. McCullough is now a partner in the same law \n     firm for which Bakaj and Zaid work. McCullough formerly \n     reported directly to Obama's National Intelligence Director, \n     James Clapper, one of Trump's biggest critics in the \n     intelligence community and a regular agitator for his \n     impeachment on CNN.\n\n\n                        Hidden Political Agenda?\n\n       Atkinson also repeatedly refused to answer Senate \n     Intelligence Committee questions about the political bias of \n     the whistleblower. Republican members of the panel called his \n     Sept. 26 testimony ``evasive.'' Senate investigators say they \n     are seeking all records generated from Atkinson's \n     ``preliminary review'' of the whistleblower's complaint, \n     including evidence and ``indicia'' of the whistleblower's \n     ``political bias'' in favor of Biden.\n       Republicans point out that Atkinson was the top national \n     security lawyer in the Obama Justice Department when it was \n     investigating Trump campaign aides and Trump himself in 2016 \n     and 2017. He worked closely with Laufman, the department's \n     former counterintelligence section chief who's now aligned \n     with the whistleblower's attorneys. Also, Atkinson served as \n     senior counsel to Mary McCord, the senior Justice official \n     appointed by Obama who helped oversee the FBI's Russia \n     ``collusion'' probe, and who personally pressured the White \n     House to fire then National Security Adviser Flynn. She and \n     Atkinson worked together on the Russia case. Closing the \n     circle tighter, McCord was Laufman's boss at Justice.\n       As it happens, all three are now involved in the \n     whistleblower case or the impeachment process.\n       After leaving the department, McCord joined the stable of \n     attorneys Democrats recruited last year to help impeach \n     Trump. She is listed as a top outside counsel for the House \n     in key legal battles tied to impeachment, including trying to \n     convince federal judges to unblock White House witnesses and \n     documents.\n       ``Michael Atkinson is a key anti-Trump conspirator who \n     played a central role in transforming the `whistleblower' \n     complaint into the current impeachment proceedings,'' said \n     Bill Marshall, a senior investigator for Judicial Watch, the \n     conservative government watchdog group that is suing the \n     Justice Department for Atkinson's internal communications \n     regarding impeachment.\n\n\n       Atkinson's office declined comment.\n\n\n                       Another `Co-Conspirator'?\n\n       During closed-door depositions taken in the impeachment \n     inquiry, Ciaramella's confederate Misko was observed handing \n     notes to Schiff's lead counsel for the impeachment inquiry, \n     Daniel Goldman--another Obama Justice attorney and a major \n     Democratic donor--as he asked questions of Trump \n     administration witnesses, officials with direct knowledge of \n     the proceedings told RealClear Investigations. Misko also was \n     observed sitting on the dais behind Democratic members during \n     last month's publicly broadcast joint impeachment committee \n     hearings.\n       Another Schiff recruit believed to part of the clandestine \n     political operation against Trump is Abby Grace, who also \n     worked closely with Ciaramella at the NSC, both before and \n     after Trump was elected. During the Obama administration, \n     Grace was an assistant to Obama national security aide Ben \n     Rhodes.\n       Last February, Schiff recruited this other White House \n     friend of the whistleblower to work as an impeachment \n     investigator. Grace is listed alongside Sean Misko as senior \n     staffers in the House Intelligence Committee's ``The Trump-\n     Ukraine Impeachment Inquiry Report'' published last month.\n       Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert, who served on one of the \n     House impeachment panels, singled out Grace and Misko as \n     Ciaramella's ``co-conspirators'' in a recent House floor \n     speech arguing for their testimony.``These people are at the \n     heart of everything about this whole Ukrainian hoax,'' \n     Gohmert said. ``We need to be able to talk to these people.''\n       A Schiff spokesman dismissed Gohmert's allegation.\n       ``These allegations about our dedicated and professional \n     staff members are patently false and are based off false \n     smears from a congressional staffer with a personal vendetta \n     from a previous job,'' said Patrick Boland, spokesman for the \n     House Intelligence Committee. ``It's shocking that members of \n     Congress would repeat them and other false conspiracy \n     theories, rather than focusing on the facts of the \n     president's misconduct.''\n       Boland declined to identify ``the congressional staffer \n     with a personal vendetta.''\n       Schiff has maintained in open hearings and interviews that \n     he did not personally speak with the whistleblower and still \n     does not even know his identity, which would mean the \n     intelligence panel's senior staff has withheld his name from \n     their chairman for almost six months. Still, he insists that \n     he knows that the CIA analyst has ``acted in good faith,'' as \n     well as ``appropriately and lawfully.''\n       The CIA declined comment. But the agency reportedly has \n     taken security measures to protect the analyst, who has \n     continued to work on issues relating to Russia and Ukraine \n     and participate in interagency meetings.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 96}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "Mr. BLUMENTHAL", "text": "  Mr. BLUMENTHAL.

Donald Trump held taxpayer-funded military aid \n     hostage from an ally at war while demanding a personal, \n     political favor. He tried to cheat, got caught, and worked \n     hard to cover it up. His actions constitute a shocking, \n     corrupt abuse of power and betrayal of his oath of office. \n     Just as a sheriff cannot delay responding to calls for help \n     until the callers endorse his re-election, the President is \n     not entitled to withhold vital military assistance from a \n     foreign ally until they announce an investigation to smear \n     his political rival. The proof shows precisely the type of \n     corruption that the Framers sought to prevent through the \n     Impeachment Clause, including foreign interference in our \n     election.\n       Two further points are significant. First, the President is \n     guilty of the crime of bribery, which is specifically listed \n     in the Constitution as a grounds for impeachment.\\1\\ Second, \n     the President's unprecedented campaign to obstruct the \n     impeachment inquiry compels us to conclude that the evidence \n     he is hiding would provide further proof of his guilt.\n     I. The President committed the federal crime of bribery\n       There is no question--based on the original meaning of the \n     Constitution, the elaboration of the impeachment clause in \n     the Federalist Papers, historical precedent, and common \n     sense--that the President need not violate a provision of any \n     criminal code in order to warrant removal from office.\\2\\ The \n     President's argument that he must violate ``established law'' \n     to be impeached would be laughable if its implications were \n     not so dangerous.\n       But there is no reasonable doubt that the President has \n     violated established law. The Constitution specifically \n     states that a President who commits bribery should be \n     impeached.\\3\\ The evidence before us establishes that \n     President Trump has committed the crime of bribery as it \n     existed at the time of the framers and now. Therefore, even \n     using the President's own standard, the Senate has no choice \n     but to convict.\n       The evidence shows that the President solicited \n     interference in the 2020 election for his own benefit by \n     pressuring Ukraine to announce an investigation into his \n     political opponents in return for releasing nearly $400 \n     million in taxpayer-funded military aid Ukraine desperately \n     needed, as well as a meeting with President Zelensky at the \n     White House. He sought, indeed demanded, a personal benefit \n     in exchange for an official act.\n       Section 201 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code criminalizes \n     ``bribery of public officials and witnesses.'' A public \n     official is guilty under this section when they seek \n     ``anything of value'' in exchange for any ``official act'' \n     and do so with corrupt intent. The code even specifies that \n     punishment for this crime may include disqualification ``from \n     holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the \n     United States.'' \\4\\\n\n     A. The requested investigations constitute ``things of value''\n\n       The investigations that President Trump requested into his \n     political enemies and to undermine claims that Russia \n     illegally helped him get elected are clearly ``things of \n     value.'' \\5\\ By all accounts, he was obsessed with them. \n     According to multiple reports, Trump cared more about the \n     investigations than he did about defending Ukraine from \n     Russia. Ambassador Gordon Sondland even testified that the \n     President ``doesn't give a s**t'' about Ukraine and only \n     cares about ``big stuff'' like the announcement of the \n     investigations he requested.\\6\\\n       Courts have consistently applied a broad and subjective \n     understanding of the phrase ``anything of value.'' All that \n     matters is that the bribe had value in the eyes of the \n     official accepting or soliciting it. The Second Circuit has \n     determined that ``anything of value'' includes stock that, \n     although it had no commercial value at the time, had \n     subjective value to the defendant.\\7\\ Similarly, the Sixth \n     Circuit held that loans that a public official would have \n     been otherwise unable to receive were ``thing[s] of value.'' \n     \\8\\ The Eighth Circuit has similarly emphasized that \n     ``anything of value'' should be interpreted ``broadly'' and \n     ``subjectively.'' \\9\\\n       Further, the ``thing'' need not be tangible, and it need \n     not be immediately available. For example, the Sixth Circuit \n     held that a promise of ``future employment'' is a thing of \n     value.\\10\\ A D.C. district court found that travel and \n     entrance to various events that Tyson Foods gave to the \n     Agriculture Secretary's girlfriend counted as things of \n     value, despite the fact that they were not given directly to \n     the Secretary and were not tangible items.\\11\\ Campaign \n     contributions also count as ``things of value,'' even \n     contributions made to Super PACs, despite Supreme Court \n     precedent holding that independent expenditures do not have \n     sufficient value to candidates to justify placing limits on \n     them.\\12\\ In other contexts, the courts have interpreted the \n     phrase ``thing of value'' to encompass a tip about the \n     whereabouts of a witness,\\13\\ information about government \n     informants,\\14\\ and the testimony of a government \n     witness.\\15\\ The courts have roundly rejected the proposition \n     that this phrase ``covers only things having commercial \n     value;'' intangibles, including information itself, can \n     certainly be a ``thing of value.'' \\16\\ The relevant inquiry \n     is not the objective value of the thing offered, but \n     ``whether the donee placed any value on the intangible \n     gifts.'' \\17\\\n       Here, President Trump clearly placed value on the \n     announcement of investigations. During the July 25 phone \n     call, Trump stated that it was ``very important'' that \n     Zelensky open these investigations.\\18\\ Over several months, \n     Trump and Rudy Giuliani had made repeated public statements \n     about how important they thought the investigations were. \n     Since at least April, 2017, President Trump has been publicly \n     promoting the debunked conspiracy theory that a California-\n     based cybersecurity company, CrowdStrike, worked with the \n     Democratic National Committee to fabricate evidence that \n     Russia interfered in the 2016 election and hide the proof of \n     their actions in Ukraine. Rudy Giuliani, the President's \n     personal attorney, has been promoting a conspiracy theory \n     about Joe and Hunter Biden since at least January, 2019.\\19\\ \n     Days after Zelensky was elected, Trump stated on air that he \n     would be directing Attorney General Barr to ``look into'' the \n     CrowdStrike conspiracy theory.\\20\\ In May, 2019, Rudy \n     Giuliani, with the knowledge and consent of President Trump \n     and acting on the President's behalf,\\21\\ planned to travel \n     to Ukraine to ask for these investigations, which he said \n     would be ``very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out \n     to be helpful to my government.'' \\22\\ On July 10, top \n     Ukrainian officials met with Energy Secretary Perry, John \n     Bolton, Kurt Volker, and Ambassador Sondland at the White \n     House where Sondland made clear that an official White House \n     visit with Zelensky was important to the President.\\23\\\n       Further, the electoral value to President Trump of \n     investigations that would smear Joe Biden and the DNC while \n     casting doubt on Russian interference in the 2016 election is \n     obvious. President Trump was elected in a shocking and narrow \n     victory after polls showed him trailing his opponent until \n     officials announced that she was under investigation.\\24\\ The \n     announcement of an investigation into his political opponents \n     clearly had tremendous value to him personally.\n       The President's counsels claim that Trump demanded \n     investigations of his political rival as part of a perfectly \n     legitimate anti-\n\n\n     corruption effort. In short, they want the Senate to leave \n     our common sense at the door. At least four undisputed facts \n     decisively disprove the claim that President Trump's actions \n     were motivated by the public interest and not his own.\n       First, as one of my colleagues has put it,\\25\\ it ``strains \n     credulity'' to suggest that President Trump was pursuing the \n     public interest and not his political benefit when the only \n     corruption investigations he could think to demand involved \n     his political opponents.\\26\\ President Trump's counsel have \n     claimed throughout this trial that the President believed \n     corruption in Ukraine to be widespread. Yet he did not \n     suggest a single investigation or programmatic action other \n     than the two investigations of his political rivals.\n       Second, President Trump did not actually want Ukraine to \n     conduct the investigations he only wanted Zelensky to \n     announce them.\\27\\ If he really did want to get to the bottom \n     of a legitimate concern, a public announcement of the \n     investigation would not further that interest. Any good \n     investigator knows that, if you actually want to get to the \n     truth, you do not prematurely tip off the subject of the \n     investigation. Indeed, federal prosecutors are instructed to \n     not even ``respond to questions about the existence of an \n     ongoing investigation or comment on its nature or progress \n     before charges are publicly filed.'' \\28\\ While announcing \n     the investigations could only harm any legitimate law \n     enforcement objective, it would obviously benefit President \n     Trump's political goals.\n       Third, President Trump never sought the investigations \n     through ordinary, official channels, or if he did seek them \n     the Justice Department declined to pursue them. If President \n     Trump wanted bona fide investigations, as opposed to \n     politically-motivated announcements, he would have charged \n     the Department of Justice with conducting an official \n     investigation, and the Department would have sought \n     cooperation from the Ukrainian government through the U.S.-\n     Ukraine Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT). Legitimate \n     requests made pursuant to an MLAT allow DOJ to take \n     testimony, obtain records, locate persons, serve documents, \n     transfer persons into U.S. custody, execute searches and \n     seizures, freeze assets, and engage in any other lawful \n     actions that the state can take.\\29\\ Trump claims that he \n     just wanted to root out criminality and corruption. But he \n     did not ask domestic U.S. law enforcement to look into the \n     matter; to date, there is no criminal investigation of Hunter \n     Biden. Instead, Trump tried to coerce a foreign government to \n     investigate a U.S. citizen without any formal coordination \n     with the U.S. Justice Department. In other words, there was \n     not a sufficient basis for a bona fide, domestic criminal \n     investigation, so Trump had to go elsewhere. The fact that \n     Trump asked a foreign government to investigate Hunter Biden \n     is not evidence that he cared about corruption; it is \n     evidence that he was engaged in corruption.\n       In fact, Ukraine ultimately resisted President Trump's \n     requests for investigations precisely because the President \n     had failed to rely on the usual channels used to prevent \n     political interference with law enforcement.\\30\\ If Trump \n     actually wanted a legitimate investigation, and wanted to \n     ensure that DOJ would be privy to relevant information, he \n     would have sought formal assistance through the U.S.-Ukraine \n     MLAT. DOJ has confirmed that he did no such thing.\\31\\ \n     Instead, President Trump acted through his personal attorney, \n     Rudy Giuliani, a man who made clear that he was duty bound to \n     pursue his boss's personal interests and not those of the \n     public.\\32\\ The only reasonable explanation for the \n     President's decision to completely bypass the Justice \n     Department is that he knew that his conspiracy theories could \n     not withstand scrutiny and he set out to circumvent law \n     enforcement officials. They were solely intended to serve \n     Trump's personal, political interests.\n       Finally, as the American Intelligence Community has \n     unanimously concluded,\\33\\ the CrowdStrike conspiracy is not \n     supported by any evidence. It is difficult to fathom how \n     propagating Russian-generated propaganda that implicates \n     American public figures and companies is in the national \n     interest of the United States. Even if his motives were \n     mixed, and he cared peripherally about corruption generally, \n     his predominant goal was to smear a political opponent.\n\nB. The release of the hold on military aid and the promised White House \n                   visit constitute ``official acts''\n\n       The two acts the President agreed to perform--releasing the \n     hold on military aid and setting up an official White House \n     meeting with Zelensky--constitute ``official acts.'' The \n     bribery statute defines ``official act'' broadly to include \n     ``any decision or action on any question, matter, cause, \n     suit, proceeding or controversy, which may at any time be \n     pending, or which may by law be brought before any public \n     official, in such official's official capacity, or in such \n     official's place of trust or profit.'' \\34\\ Military \n     assistance and an official White House visit were within his \n     control only because of his tenure in elective office. In \n     fact, both receiving foreign dignitaries and providing \n     foreign assistance are in the President's official, \n     constitutional job description.\\35\\\n       Actions authorized by statute, such as the ones President \n     Trump took here, are particularly clear examples of official \n     acts.\\36\\ Congress has specifically authorized, and \n     circumscribed, the President's ability to award military \n     assistance to foreign countries. This process has been \n     codified since the early 1960s, and there is an enormous \n     federal apparatus devoted to evaluating the needs of foreign \n     nations, how those needs intersect with legitimate U.S. \n     foreign policy interests, and how to award foreign aid in \n     line with those interests.\\37\\ Further, when the President \n     placed a hold on the aid, he was acting on behalf of the \n     United States, not in his personal capacity. It defies reason \n     to argue that the President's decision to award, or fail to \n     execute, a foreign aid determination is not an ``official \n     act'' under the bribery statute.\n       Similarly, an official White House meeting is an ``official \n     act'' because the President is specifically ``assigned by \n     law'' \\38\\--in both the Constitution and numerous statutes--\n     with receiving representatives from foreign governments.\\39\\ \n     Indeed, the authority to receive ambassadors and recognize \n     foreign governments is considered so core to the office of \n     the President that the Supreme Court has struck down statutes \n     that interfere with it.\\40\\\n\n            C. The President corruptly sought a quid pro quo\n\n       President Trump made an agreement with the specific intent \n     to be influenced in his decision whether to lift the hold on \n     the military aid and to host a White House meeting. In United \n     States v. Sun-Diamond Growers of California, the Supreme \n     Court held that a bribe made or solicited ``in return for'' \n     an official act entails an exchange, a quid pro quo.\\41\\ In a \n     seminal case, the D.C. Circuit reasoned that the term \n     ``corruptly'' means that the official act would not be \n     undertaken (or undertaken in a particular way) without the \n     thing of value.\\42\\\n       Department of Justice guidance on the issue, citing the \n     standard jury instructions that numerous courts have upheld, \n     indicates that ``corruptly'' denotes ``nothing more than . . \n     . acting `with bad purpose' to achieve some unlawful end.'' \n     \\43\\ The guidance further explains that, ordinarily, this \n     ``bad purpose'' is ``a hope or expectation of either \n     financial gain or other benefit to one's self, or some aid or \n     profit or benefit to another.''\\44\\ In other words, the \n     intent merely to be influenced in the way prohibited by the \n     bribery statute itself is sufficient to find that the \n     defendant acted ``corruptly.''\n       Further, the Supreme Court unanimously held in 2016 that \n     the quid pro quo demand ``need not be explicit,'' the \n     official ``need not specify the means that he will use to \n     perform his end of the bargain,'' nor must the official \n     actually intend to follow through for a prosecutor to succeed \n     in making her case that the defendant is guilty of \n     bribery.\\45\\ In a Seventh Circuit case, the court made clear \n     that the context of a communication can be determinative: \n     evidence of a quid pro quo can emerge from ``the often \n     clandestine atmosphere of corruption with a simple wink and a \n     nod if the surrounding circumstances make it clear that \n     something of value will pass to a public official if he takes \n     improper, or withholds proper, action.'' \\46\\ While the \n     defendant in that case never made an explicit offer and never \n     relayed a specific amount of money, the court nonetheless \n     upheld his conviction for bribery.\\47\\\n       Trump's actions clearly qualify as a quid pro quo. Less \n     than a month prior to this phone call, President Trump had \n     put a hold on hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid \n     to Ukraine and had previously set in motion, but not \n     committed to, an official White House visit with Ukraine's \n     new president, Volodomyr Zelensky. When Trump and Zelensky \n     spoke on July 25, Trump set the terms of the conversation by \n     making clear that he felt Ukraine owed him for America's \n     generosity. And as soon as Zelensky mentioned that Ukraine \n     was interested in receiving American anti-tank missiles, the \n     President immediately stated that he would like Zelensky to \n     ``do us a favor though,'' and explicitly asked Zelensky to \n     investigate the Biden conspiracy theory and alleged Ukrainian \n     interference in the 2016 election. As soon as Zelensky \n     appeared to agree to open the requested investigations, Trump \n     almost immediately assured the Ukrainian President that \n     ``whenever you would like to come to the White House, feel \n     free to call.'' \\48\\ Text messages sent by Special Envoy \n     Volker indicate that it had also been made clear to the \n     Ukrainians prior to the call that the official White House \n     visit was also conditioned upon Zelensky complying with \n     Trump's request for these investigations.\\49\\ Gordon \n     Sondland, the American ambassador to the EU, testified that \n     the President's proposal to lift the hold in exchange for the \n     investigations was as clear as ``two plus two equals four.'' \n     \\50\\ Trump's acting Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, confessed \n     during a press conference that there was a quid pro quo \n     exchange and suggested that the public should just ``get over \n     it.'' \\51\\\n       The implication of Trump's message to Zelensky on the July \n     25 phone call is that Trump would not lift the hold or have \n     the White House meeting unless Zelensky opened the requested \n     investigations. The obvious political value to the President \n     of opening these investigations constitutes sufficient \n     grounds for a jury to determine that he had a ``bad motive'' \n     in making this request. Trump is guilty of quid pro quo \n     bribery.\n\n                 D. Trump's defenses are not persuasive\n\n       Trump attempts to absolve his behavior by arguing that his \n     subjective intent is irrelevant to whether he committed an \n     impeachable offense, that there is no quid pro quo because \n     Ukraine never announced the infamous investigations, and \n     that, even if he did commit a quid pro quo, he cannot be \n     impeached\n\n\n     because the articles do not accuse him of bribery. Even \n     setting aside that these defenses ignore the fact that Trump \n     still has not held a White House meeting with Zelensky, these \n     arguments are wholly unpersuasive in their own right.\n\n           1. Trump's subjective intent is eminently relevant\n\n       Trump claims that his subjective intent is irrelevant; that \n     he cannot be impeached based on the reasons for which he \n     sought the investigations.\\52\\ This argument is specious for \n     at least three reasons. First, the two offenses that the \n     Constitution explicitly mentions as requiring removal from \n     office--treason and bribery--hinge on the subjective reasons \n     that the official acted. If the Commander-in-Chief orders the \n     military to take certain actions with the purpose of \n     benefiting an enemy of the United States, then the President \n     has committed treason, even if the President generally has \n     the authority to command the armed forces. If the President \n     vetoes a law because someone has paid him a large bribe, then \n     he has committed bribery, even if the President generally has \n     the authority to veto laws. When we are prohibited from \n     scrutinizing the President's reasons for acting, we lose the \n     ability to protect our democracy from tyrants and traitors.\n       Second, the President maintains that he needs to have \n     violated ``established law'' in order to be impeached.\\53\\ \n     Using the President's own standard, then, in evaluating \n     whether he violated the federal bribery statute, we must \n     evaluate whether he acted with corrupt intent. If the \n     President wants to be scrutinized using the standards of the \n     federal criminal code, then he must concede that his \n     subjective intent is at issue.\n       Third, even if Trump had other reasons for releasing the \n     aid, it was still a crime for him to even ask for the \n     investigations. Section 201(c) of Title 18 prohibits public \n     officials from demanding anything of value ``for or because \n     of any official act.'' \\54\\ The courts have been clear that \n     even if the official act ``might have been done without'' the \n     bribe, the defendant is still guilty under section \n     201(c).\\55\\ Even if Trump never actually intended to maintain \n     a hold on the aid, even if he decided to release the aid for \n     entirely legitimate reasons, the fact that he requested the \n     investigations as a ``favor'' \\56\\--because of how generous \n     the President was in agreeing to conduct a White House visit \n     or lifting the hold on the military aid--means that the \n     President committed a crime.\n       Even if a legislator would have voted for a piece of \n     legislation because he thinks it is in the public interest, \n     he still commits bribery if he takes a payoff to do it. As \n     the courts have made clear, an illegal bribe under this \n     section may take the form of ``a reward [. . .] for a past \n     act that has already been taken.'' \\57\\ Thus, the fact that \n     the President continued to ask for the investigations after \n     the hold was finally released \\58\\ does not absolve him; it \n     further incriminates him.\n\n     2. Trump completed his crime the moment he solicited the bribe\n\n       It is undisputed that the President, either directly or \n     indirectly, demanded investigations into Joe Biden and a \n     conspiracy theory involving the Democratic National \n     Committee. The President's only response is that he cannot be \n     liable because he did not receive what he requested. Under \n     federal law, however, a corrupt official need not receive the \n     benefit he demands or perform the official acts in question; \n     ``it is enough that the official agreed to do so.'' \\59\\ It \n     is the solicitation of a private benefit in and of itself \n     that constitutes the crime.\\60\\ All a prosecutor would have \n     to demonstrate is that the President made an agreement or \n     offer to exchange official acts for a thing of value.\n       We know from the memorandum of the July 25 phone call, from \n     Volker and Sondland's texts, and from Sondland's testimony \n     that Trump had agreed to lift the hold and conduct the White \n     House meeting in exchange for the investigations.\\61\\ We also \n     know that there is additional evidence out there that speaks \n     to the President's communications--both directly and through \n     his agents--with Ukraine regarding his illegal scheme. We \n     know, at the very least, of the existence of diplomatic \n     cables from the Ukrainian embassy about the hold on the \n     military assistance and communications with the State \n     Department about the hold.\\62\\ The head of the agency that \n     placed the hold on the military assistance has refused to \n     respond to a lawful subpoena, under the instruction of the \n     White House.\\63\\ As discussed below, when a party fails to \n     produce or obstructs access to relevant evidence, that \n     failure ``gives rise to an inference that the evidence is \n     unfavorable to him.'' \\64\\ In this case, although the \n     evidence already presented proves the crime of bribery, the \n     Senate should infer that the evidence that the executive \n     branch has hidden about these communications would provide \n     further evidence that Trump agreed to this illicit exchange.\n\n3. Senators must convict if they conclude that the President committed \nthe crime of bribery, whether or not the term `bribery' appears in the \n                                articles\n\n       The first article of impeachment accuses the President of \n     ``corruptly solicit[ing]'' the public announcement of \n     investigations that were in his ``personal political \n     benefit,'' in exchange for ``two official acts.'' \\65\\ In \n     response to questions from Senators, Trump's counsel has \n     argued that because the article did not explicitly refer to \n     the crime of bribery, Trump was provided inadequate notice. \n     This argument is absurd.\n       Trump has received plenty of notice that he stands accused \n     of bribery. Trump's actions, as described in the article, \n     clearly align with the elements of the federal crime of \n     bribery: he solicited a thing of value in exchange for \n     official acts and did so with corrupt intent.\\66\\ Further, \n     the House Judiciary Committee report adeptly explained why \n     the President is guilty of bribery under the criminal \n     code.\\67\\ Lawmakers have been discussing the President's \n     misdeeds in terms of bribery for months now.\\68\\ His lack of \n     a defense is due not to lack of notice but to lack of facts.\n       The historical record confirms the common sense notion that \n     the articles need not name specific crimes. In 1974, the \n     House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of \n     impeachment against President Nixon, none of which referenced \n     any provisions of any criminal code.\\69\\ Many of my \n     colleagues were presented with similarly drafted articles of \n     impeachment against Judge Porteous in 2010. In that instance, \n     the House adopted four articles of impeachment, none of which \n     explicitly referenced the criminal code.\\70\\ The first \n     article described conduct that amounts to bribery--claiming \n     that Judge Porteous ``solicited and accepted things of \n     value'' in exchange for ruling in favor of a particular \n     party--but never used the term ``bribe'' or mentioned the \n     federal bribery statute.\\71\\ The Senate unanimously convicted \n     Judge Porteous on this article and voted to forever \n     disqualify him from holding office.\\72\\ No one seriously \n     entertained the notice argument then, and there is no good \n     reason to do so now. This bad faith defense is a red herring, \n     and we must not let it distract us from the issue before us: \n     the President's crimes.\n       Trump's claim that he cannot be removed for a crime unless \n     the crime is specifically mentioned in the articles of \n     impeachment--coupled with his claim that there must be proof \n     of a crime--is simply untenable. By Trump's flawed logic, if \n     he had been impeached for ``shooting someone on Fifth \n     Avenue,'' he could not be removed for ``murder'' unless that \n     word was specifically included in the articles. We have not \n     been called to sit in judgment of the House of \n     Representatives' diction; we sit in judgment of the \n     President's actions--carefully and precisely described in the \n     articles of impeachment as a clear-cut case of bribery.\n\n   II. The President's unprecedented campaign to obstruct access to \n relevant evidence compels us to conclude that the evidence is against \n                                  him.\n\n       The House of Representatives has made a very strong case \n     that the President's refusal to engage in any way with their \n     investigation is unlawful and constitutionally offensive. But \n     make no mistake--this conflict is more than a dispute between \n     the branches of government. The House of Representatives and \n     a number of Senators have raised the alarm bells not for our \n     own sake, but because when the President hides from Congress, \n     he hides from the American people. The separation of powers \n     does not exist to benefit members of Congress; it exists to \n     curb the excesses of enormously powerful government \n     officials.\n       Throughout this entire ordeal--from the moment the call \n     transcript was improperly placed on a classified server \\73\\ \n     to the time when Trump threatened to unlawfully assert \n     executive privilege over any testimony requested by the \n     Senate \\74\\--the President has sought to keep his illegal \n     scheme secret from the very people the scheme was designed to \n     manipulate: the American electorate.\n       Indeed, the withholding of aid itself was concealed, unlike \n     with other similar pauses or suspensions of military \n     assistance.\n       The law and historical precedent are clear--when the \n     President stifles Congress' investigative authority, whether \n     during an impeachment inquiry or when Congress is exercising \n     its broader mandate to investigate the executive branch, he \n     has exceeded the bounds of the law. Because Trump has flouted \n     congressional inquiry in such a brazen and unhinged manner, \n     this violation alone requires us to vote to remove him from \n     office.\n       Separately, this egregious campaign of obfuscation \n     strengthens the case against the President for abuse of \n     power. As a matter of law, when a party to a case improperly \n     withholds relevant evidence, courts can instruct juries to \n     make an adverse inference--to assume that the evidence would \n     be unfavorable to the withholding party. In this case, Trump \n     has withheld every single piece of evidence that the House \n     requested. The facts before us confirm the underlying logic \n     of the adverse inference rule--that when a party hides \n     something, it is because they have something to hide. \n     Applying that rule here, the already overwhelming evidence \n     against Trump becomes an avalanche.\n\n A. Trump's obstruction requires us to infer that all the evidence is \n against him, which only strengthens the case for removal for abuse of \n                                 power\n\n       It is a long-established rule of law that when a party \n     ``has relevant evidence within his control which he fails to \n     produce, that failure gives rise to an inference that the \n     evidence is unfavorable to him.'' \\75\\ Importantly, this rule \n     applies even in the absence of a subpoena and, in fact, ``the \n     willingness of a party to defy a subpoena in order to \n     suppress the evidence strengthens the force of the \n     preexisting inference,'' because in that scenario ``it can \n     hardly be doubted he has some good reason for his \n     insistence on suppression.'' \\76\\ Indeed, the courts have \n     recognized that the adverse inference rule is essential to\n\n\n     prevent intransigent parties from abusing ``costly and \n     time consuming'' court proceedings to subvert their legal \n     duty to produce relevant evidence.\\77\\ The Supreme Court \n     has specifically applied this rule against a party who \n     selectively provided weak evidence and failed to allow \n     those persons with the most relevant knowledge to testify, \n     noting that ``the production of weak evidence when strong \n     is available can lead only to the conclusion that the \n     strong would have been adverse.'' \\78\\ As the Court put \n     it, in circumstances like this, ``silence then becomes \n     evidence of the most convincing character.'' \\79\\\n       We know that the Trump administration has relevant evidence \n     that it refuses to produce. As an initial matter, the \n     President has failed to comply with a single request from the \n     House of Representatives, and, following the President's \n     orders, the White House, the office of the Vice President, \n     the Office of Management and Budget, the State Department, \n     the Department of Defense, and the Department of Energy \n     refused to produce a single document in response to 71 \n     specific requests issued by the House of Representatives.\\80\\\n       But we also know of specific pieces of evidence that go to \n     the heart of the House's case and that Trump is concealing. \n     Mark Sandy testified that in August, OMB produced a \n     memorandum recommending that the President's hold on the \n     Ukraine military assistance be released.\\81\\ William Taylor \n     testified that on August 29, he sent a first person cable to \n     Secretary Pompeo, relaying his concerns about the ``folly I \n     saw in withholding military aid to Ukraine at a time when \n     hostilities were still active in the east and when Russia was \n     watching closely to gauge the level of American support for \n     the Ukrainian Government.'' \\82\\ Mr. Taylor also testified \n     that he had exchanged WhatsApp messages with Ambassadors \n     Volker and Sondland as well as with Ukrainian officials. The \n     White House has refused to release any of these documents. We \n     therefore must infer that they demonstrate that there was no \n     interagency process to review the best use of the funds--that \n     this rationale was pre-textual.\n       The White House maintains that Ukraine was not even aware \n     of the hold on the military assistance until after it was \n     reported on publicly. But we have testimony to the contrary--\n     testimony that includes reference to specific documents that \n     the President is withholding. Laura K. Cooper, the American \n     deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and \n     Eurasia, testified that her staff received two emails on July \n     25th that directly undermine Trump's claim. The first, \n     received at 2:31 PM, stated that the Ukrainian embassy was \n     asking about the security assistance. The second, received at \n     4:25 PM, stated that the Ukrainian embassy knew that the \n     foreign military financing assistance had been held up.\\83\\ \n     At the behest of President Trump, the State Department has \n     not released these emails. Unless and until the \n     administration produces these documents and any others \n     bearing on when Ukraine first learned about the hold, we \n     should assume that they demonstrate that Ukraine knew about \n     the hold when Trump spoke to Zelensky on July 25.\n\nB. The evidence that has emerged despite Trump's intransigence has only \n                     bolstered the case against him\n\n       Based on the above analysis alone, the Senate is more than \n     entitled to infer that the mountain of evidence that Trump is \n     withholding would demonstrate his guilt. But two further \n     points compel us to make such an inference. First, Trump \n     confessed on national television to having ``all the \n     materials'' and bragged about how he had kept them from \n     Congress.\\84\\ We cannot let this gleeful boast stand without \n     inferring that the materials in question speak to Trump's \n     guilt.\n       Second, as the House managers repeatedly cautioned us would \n     happen, the evidence that Trump has been hiding has started \n     to come out. And each newly revealed tape or record has been \n     unfavorable to the President's case. The assumption that the \n     law compels us to make about the contents of these \n     materials--that they demonstrate the President's guilt--is \n     confirmed each and every time they come out into the light. \n     Most damning has been the leak of a draft of John Bolton's \n     forthcoming book, which confirms that the President ``told \n     his national security adviser in August that he wanted to \n     continue freezing $391 million in security assistance to \n     Ukraine until officials there helped with investigations into \n     Democrats including the Bidens,'' as well as details about \n     the involvement of various senior cabinet officials in \n     Trump's illegal scheme.\\85\\ And this is only the most recent \n     revelation in a rapidly growing series of records that have \n     come to light. On January 14, 2020, Lev Parnas, a former \n     associate of Rudy Giuliani, released documents which \n     demonstrate both that the President was orchestrating a deal \n     to get Zelensky to ``announce that the Biden case will be \n     investigated,'' and that Marie Yovanovitch was the subject of \n     an illegal intimidation campaign.\\86\\ On January 25, 2020, a \n     tape from April, 2018 was publicly released of a private \n     dinner with top donors where Trump is heard yelling: ``Get \n     rid of her! Get her out tomorrow. I don't care. Get her out \n     tomorrow. Take her out. Okay? Do it,'' in reference to \n     Ambassador Yovanovitch.\\87\\ The President is also heard \n     specifically asking how long Ukraine would last in a war \n     against Russia absent U.S. support--in other words, inquiring \n     how much Ukraine is at the mercy of the United States.\\88\\ \n     Not only does this tape provide further evidence of a \n     coordinated campaign against the Ambassador; it also \n     undermines ``earlier defenses by the White House that Trump \n     wasn't aware of what was taking place in the early phase of \n     the Ukraine affair.'' \\89\\ This tape suggests that Trump not \n     only knew about the Ukraine affair, but also that ``he may \n     have been directing events'' as early as April 2018.\\90\\\n       The steady drip of damning evidence leaking from the \n     President's associates, combined with Trump's own public \n     confession to concealing relevant evidence, compels us to \n     conclude what the law already instructs us to infer: that the \n     mountain of evidence Trump is hiding proves his guilt.\n     Conclusion\n       It is clear to me that Trump is guilty of bribery and that \n     his campaign to obstruct any investigation into his \n     wrongdoing only strengthens the case against him. Trump's \n     actions require us to vote to remove him from office. When \n     the Framers included the impeachment power in the \n     Constitution, they knew that there would be a presidential \n     election every four years--and they also knew that this was \n     an insufficient check against a President who abuses the \n     power of his office to cheat his way to re-election. Trump's \n     misdeeds are a case study in the need for impeachment.\n       Throughout the impeachment trial, I have been moved by the \n     grave moral purpose that the Senate is charged with \n     pursuing--of sustaining America as an idea, of our \n     Constitution as a living document that gives substance to our \n     identity as the world's leading democracy. As we sit in \n     judgment of a President who has demonstrated nothing but \n     contempt for our laws and our values, history sits in \n     judgment of the Senate. By failing to remove Trump from \n     office, we will have failed our country.\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 99}, {"kind": "title", "speaker": "None", "text": "                                ENDNOTES\n\n       1.

Mr. President, when I was elected to serve in the U.S. \nSenate, I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the \nUnited States. Every U.S. Senator takes the same oath. The Constitution \nmakes clear that no one is above the law, not even the President of the \nUnited States.\n  Over the past 2 weeks, the Senate has heard overwhelming evidence \nshowing that the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, \nabused the power of his office to pressure the President of Ukraine to \ndig up dirt on a political rival to help President Trump in the next \nelection. The President then executed an unprecedented campaign to \ncover up his actions, including a wholesale obstruction of Congress's \neffort to investigate his abuse of power.\n  The Constitution gives the Senate the sole power to conduct \nimpeachment trials. A fair trial is one in which Senators are allowed \nto see and hear all of the relevant information needed to evaluate the \nArticles of Impeachment, including relevant witnesses and documents. \nThe American people expected and deserved a fair trial, but that is not \nwhat they got. Instead of engaging in a pursuit for the truth, Senate \nRepublicans locked arms with the President and refused to subpoena a \nsingle witness or document. They even refused to allow the testimony of \nthe President's former National Security Advisor, John Bolton, who \npossesses direct evidence related to the issues at the heart of the \ntrial, even as more evidence continued to come to light and as Bolton \nrepeatedly volunteered to share what he knows.\n  This trial boils down to one word: corruption--the corruption of a \nPresident who has repeatedly put his interests ahead of the interests \nof the American people and violated the Constitution in the process; \nthe corruption of this President's political appointees, including \nindividuals like U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, \nwho paid $1 million for an ambassadorship; the corruption running \nthroughout our government that protects and defends the interests of \nthe wealthy and powerful to the detriment of everyone else.\n  Americans have a right to hear and see information that further \nexposes the gravity of the President's actions and the unprecedented \nsteps he and his agents took to hide it from the American people. But \nmore importantly, Americans deserve to know that the President of the \nUnited States is using the power of his office to work in the Nation's \ninterest, not his own personal interest.\n  I voted to convict and to remove the President from office in order \nto stand up to the corruption that has permeated this administration \nand that was on full display with President Trump's abuse of power and \nobstruction of Congress. I will continue to call out this corruption \nand fight to make this government work not just for the wealthy and \nwell-connected but to make it work for everyone.", "turn": 78, "speaker_bioguide": "W000817", "itemno": 101}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "Mr. PETERS", "text": "  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I swore an oath to defend the Constitution\n\n\nboth as an officer in the U.S. Navy Reserve and as a U.S. Senator.\n  At the beginning of the impeachment trial, I swore an oath to keep an \nopen mind, listen carefully to the facts, and in the end deliver \nimpartial justice.\n  After carefully listening to the arguments presented by both House \nmanagers and the President's lawyers, I believe the facts are clear.\n  President Trump stands accused by the House of Representatives of \nabusing his power in an attempt to extort a foreign government to \nannounce a trumped up investigation into a political rival and thereby \nput his personal interest ahead of national security and the public \ntrust.\n  The President illegally withheld congressionally approved military \naid to an ally at war with Russia and conditioned its release on \nUkraine making an announcement the President could use to falsely \ndiscredit a likely political opponent.\n  When the President's corrupt plan was brought to light, the White \nHouse engaged in a systematic and unprecedented effort to cover up the \nscheme.\n  The President's complete refusal to cooperate with a constitutionally \nauthorized investigation is unparalleled in American history.\n  Despite the extraordinary efforts by the President to cover up the \nfacts, the House managers made a convincing case.\n  It is clear.\n  The President's actions were not an effort to further official \nAmerican foreign policy.\n  The President was not working in the public interest.\n  What the President did was wrong, unacceptable, and impeachable.\n  I expected the President's lawyers to offer new eyewitness testimony \nfrom people with firsthand knowledge and offer new documents to defend \nthe President, but that did not happen.\n  It became very clear to me that the President's closest advisers \ncould not speak to the President's innocence, and his lawyers did \neverything in their power to prevent them from testifying under oath.\n  Witness testimony is the essence of a fair trial. It is what makes us \na country committed to the rule of law.\n  If you are accused of wrongdoing in America, you have every right to \ncall witnesses in your defense, but you also don't have the right to \nstop the prosecution from calling a hostile witness or subpoenaing \ndocuments.\n  No one in this country is above the law--no one--not even the \nPresident.\n  If someone is accused of a crime and they have witnesses who could \nclear them of any wrongdoing, they would want those witnesses to \ntestify. In fact, not only would they welcome it, they would insist on \nit.\n  All we need to do is use our common sense. The fact that the \nPresident refuses to have his closest advisers testify tells me that he \nis afraid of what they will say.\n  The President's conduct is unacceptable for any official, let alone \nthe leader of our country.\n  Our Nation's Founders feared unchecked and unlimited power by the \nPresident. They rebelled against an abusive monarch with unlimited \npower and instead created a republic that distributed power across \ndifferent branches of government.\n  They were careful students of history; they knew unchecked power \nwould destroy a democratic republic.\n  They were especially fearful of an unchecked Executive and \nspecifically granted Congress the power of impeachment to check a \nPresident who thought of themselves as above the law.\n  Two years ago, I had the privilege of participating in an annual \nbipartisan Senate tradition reading President George Washington's \nfarewell address on the Senate floor.\n  In that address, President Washington warned that unchecked power, \nthe rise of partisan factions, and foreign influence, if left \nunchecked, would undermine our young Nation and allow for the rise of a \ndemagogue.\n  He warned that we could become so divided and so entrenched in the \nbeliefs of our particular partisan group that ``cunning, ambitious and \nunprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and \nto usurp for themselves the reins of government.''\n  I am struck by the contrast of where we are today and where our \nFounders were more than 200 years ago.\n  George Washington was the ultimate rock star of his time. He was \nbeloved, and when he announced he would leave the Presidency and return \nto Mount Vernon, people begged him to stay.\n  There was a call to make him a King, and he said no. He reminded \nfolks that he had just fought against a monarch so that the American \npeople could enjoy the liberties of a free people.\n  George Washington, a man of integrity and an American hero, refused \nto be anointed King when it was offered to him by his adoring \ncountrymen. He chose a republic over a monarchy.\n  But tomorrow, by refusing to hold President Trump accountable for his \nabuses, Republicans in the Senate are offering him unbridled power \nwithout accountability, and he will gleefully seize that power.\n  And when he does, our Republic will face an existential threat.\n  A vote against the Articles of Impeachment will set a dangerous \nprecedent and will be used by future Presidents to act with impunity.\n  Given what we know, that the President abused the power of his office \nby attempting to extort a foreign government to interfere with an \nAmerican election, that he willfully obstructed justice at every turn, \nand that his actions run counter to our Nation's most cherished and \nfundamental values, it is clear the President betrayed the trust the \nAmerican public placed in him to fully execute his constitutional \nresponsibilities.\n  This betrayal is by definition a high crime and misdemeanor. If it \ndoes not rise to the level of impeachment and removal, I am not sure \nwhat would.\n  The Senate has a constitutional responsibility to hold him \naccountable.\n  If we do not stand up and defend our democracy during this fragile \nperiod, we will be allowing this President and future Presidents to \nhave unchecked power.\n  This is not what our Founders intended. The oath I swore to protect \nand defend the Constitution demands that I vote to preserve the future \nof our Republic. I will faithfully execute my oath and vote to hold \nthis President accountable for his actions.", "turn": 79, "speaker_bioguide": "P000595", "itemno": 102}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "Mr. COTTON", "text": "  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I will soon join a majority of the Senate \nin voting down the Articles of Impeachment brought against the \nPresident by his partisan opponents. The time has come to end a \nspectacle that has elevated the obsessions of Washington's political \nclass over the concerns and interests of the American people.\n  This round of impeachment is just the latest Democratic scheme to \nbring down the President. I say ``this round'' because House Democrats \nhave tried to impeach President Trump at least four times--first, for \nbeing mean to football players; then for his transgender military \npolicy; next for his immigration policy. And those are just the \nimpeachment attempts. Along the way, Democrats also proclaimed that \nRobert Mueller would drive the President from office. Some even \nspeculated that the Vice President and the Cabinet would invoke the \n25th amendment to seize power from the President--a theory that sounds \nmore like resistance fan fiction than reality.\n  What is behind this fanaticism? Simply put, the Democrats have never \naccepted that Donald Trump won the 2016 election, and they will never \nforgive him, either.\n  It is time for the Democrats to get some perspective. They are \nclaiming that we ought to impeach and remove a President from office \nfor the first time in our history for briefly pausing aid to Ukraine \nand rescheduling a meeting with the Ukrainian President, allegedly in \nreturn for a corruption inquiry. But the aid was released after a few \nweeks and the meeting occurred, yet the inquiry did not--even though, I \nwould add, it remains justified by the Biden family's obvious, glaring \nconflict of interest in Ukraine.\n  Just how badly have the Democrats lost perspective? The House \nmanagers have argued that we ought to impeach and remove the President \nbecause his meeting with the Ukrainian President happened in New York, \nnot Washington.\n  When most Americans think about why a President ought to be impeached \nand removed from office for the first time in our history, I suspect \nthat pausing aid to Ukraine for a few weeks is pretty far down the \nlist. That is not exactly ``treason, bribery, or other\n\n\nhigh crimes and misdemeanors.'' And that is especially true when we are \njust months away from the election that will let Americans make their \nown choice. Indeed, Americans are already voting to select the \nPresident's Democratic challenger. Why not let the voters decide \nwhether the President ought to be removed?\n  The Democrats' real answer is that they are afraid they will lose \nagain in 2020, so they designed impeachment to hurt the President \nbefore the election. As one Democratic congressman said last year, \n``I'm concerned that if we don't impeach this president, he will get \nreelected.'' Or, as minority leader Chuck Schumer claimed earlier this \nmonth, impeachment is a ``win-win'' for Democrats; either it will lead \nto the President's defeat or it will hurt enough Republican Senators in \ntough races to hand Democrats the majority. Or maybe both.\n  The political purpose of impeachment was clear from the manner in \nwhich House Democrats conducted their proceedings. If impeachment was \nindeed the high-minded, somber affair that Speaker Nancy Pelosi \nclaimed, House Democrats would have taken their time to get all the \nfacts from all relevant witnesses. Instead, they barreled ahead with a \nslipshod and secretive process, denying the President's due-process \nrights, gathering testimony behind closed doors, leaking their findings \nselectively to the press, and ignoring constitutional concerns such as \nexecutive privilege.\n  The impeachment vote itself contradicted the pretensions of House \nDemocrats. Speaker Pelosi said last year that she wouldn't support \nimpeachment unless there was something ``so compelling and overwhelming \nand bipartisan'' that it demanded a response. Likewise, Congressman \nJerry Nadler said that the House had to ``persuade enough of the \nopposition party voters'' before it voted to impeach. Democrats failed \non both counts. Indeed, the only bipartisan aspect of the whole \nproceeding is that both Republicans and Democrats voted against \nimpeaching the president. Not a single Republican voted for either \narticle of impeachment in the House, resulting in the first party-line \nimpeachment of a President in our Nation's history.\n  So instead of doing their work, House Democrats simply impeached the \nPresident and declared their job complete. Yet after piously declaring \nthe urgency of this impeachment, they waited a month to send the \narticles over to the Senate. Maybe they had to wait for the gold-\nencrusted souvenir pens to arrive for Speaker Pelosi's ``signing \nceremony.''\n  And once in the Senate, the political theater continued. The House \nDemocrats repeatedly asserted a bizarre logical fallacy: their case was \nboth ``overwhelming'' and in need of more evidence. Yet we heard from \n17 witnesses--all hand-selected by the House Democrats--and received \nmore than 28,000 pages of documents. The House could have pursued more \nwitnesses during its impeachment, yet it instead chose to rush ahead \nrather than subpoena those witnesses or litigate issues in Federal \ncourt. In fact, when one of the House's potential witnesses asked a \nFederal court to rule on the issue, the House withdrew its subpoena and \nasked to dismiss the case. The House Democrats complain that the courts \nwould have taken too long. Yet they expected the Senate to delay our \nwork to finish theirs. And in a final, remarkable stunt, Congressman \nAdam Schiff suggested that we depose witnesses--only his, of course, \nnot the President's--with Chief Justice Roberts ruling on all questions \nof evidence and privilege, dragging him into this political spectacle.\n  But the curtain will soon come down on this political theater. The \nSenate will perform the role intended for us by the Founders, of \nproviding the ``cool and deliberate sense of the community,'' as it \nsays in Federalist 63, over and against an inflamed and transient House \nmajority. Were we to do otherwise, were the Senate to acquiesce to the \nHouse, this process might have dragged on for many weeks, even for \nmonths, shutting down the normal legislative business of Congress even \nlonger than it already has.\n  Even worse, by legitimizing the House's flawed, partisan impeachment, \nwe would be setting a grave precedent for the future. Just consider how \nmany times we heard about the impeachment trial of President Andrew \nJohnson during this trial. The Founders didn't intend impeachment as a \ntool to check the Executive over policy disagreements or out of \npolitical spite. And the House has never before used impeachment in \nthis way, not when the Democrats claimed that President George W. Bush \nmisled the country into the Iraq war or when President Barack Obama \nbroke the law by releasing terrorists from Guantanamo Bay in return for \nthe release of an American deserter, Bowe Bergdahl. Indeed, the \nRepublican House did not impeach President Obama for, yes, withholding \naid from Ukraine for 3 full years.\n  No House in the future should lead the country down this path again. \nBy refusing to do this House's dirty work, the Senate is stopping this \ndangerous precedent and preserving the Founders' understanding that \nCongress ought to restrain the executive through the many checks and \nbalances still at our disposal. More fundamentally, we are preserving \nthe most important check of all--an election. It is time to teach that \nlesson to this House and to all future Houses, of both parties.\n  Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff have failed, but the American people \nlost. Now it is time to get back to doing the people's business.", "turn": 80, "speaker_bioguide": "C001095", "itemno": 103}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "Mr. SULLIVAN", "text": "  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nimpeachment of Donald J. Trump.\n  The Democratic House managers, who are prosecuting the case against \nthe President, emphasized that history is watching. That is true. Every \naction taken by the House and the Senate during this impeachment sets a \nprecedent for our country and our institutions of government, whether \ngood or bad.\n  For that reason, it is our job as Senators to look at the entire \nrecord of this proceeding--from what happened in the House to final \narguments made here in the Senate. It is also our duty to look at the \nwhole picture, the flawed process in the House, the purely partisan \nnature of the articles of impeachment, the President's actions that led \nto his impeachment, and the impact of all of this on our constitutional \nnorms.\n  Most importantly, we must weigh the impact on our Nation and on the \nlegitimacy of our institutions of government, if the Senate were to \nagree with the House managers' demands to overturn the 2016 election \nand remove the President from the 2020 ballot. This has never happened \nin our country's 243-year history.\n  It is also our job as Senators during an impeachment trial to be \nguided by ``a deep responsibility to future times.'' This is a quote \nfrom U.S. Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, two centuries ago, but it \ncouldn't be more relevant today. With this grave constitutional \nresponsibility in mind, and considering the important factors listed \nabove, I will vote to acquit the President on both charges brought \nagainst him.\n  It may surprise some, but if you listened to all the witnesses in \nthis trial and you examine the sweep of American history, one strong \nbipartisan point of consensus has emerged: Purely partisan impeachments \nare not in the country's best interest. In fact, they are a danger \nwhich the Framers of the Constitution clearly feared.\n  Alexander Hamilton's warning from Federalist No. 65 bears repeating: \n``In many cases [impeachment] will connect itself with the pre-existing \nfactions, and will inlist all their animosities, partialities, \ninfluence, and interest on one side or on the other; and in such cases \nthere will always be the greatest danger that the decision will be \nregulated more by the comparative strength of parties, than by the real \ndemonstrations of innocence or guilt . . . Yet it ought not to be \nforgotten that the demon of faction will, at certain seasons, extend \nhis sceptre over all numerous bodies of men.''\n  The reason for this ``greatest danger'' is obvious: the weaponization \nof impeachment as a regular tool of partisan warfare will incapacitate \nour government, undermine the legitimacy of our institutions, and tear \nthe country apart. Until this impeachment, our country's \nrepresentatives largely understood this. During the Clinton \nimpeachment--Democrats, including Minority Leader Schumer and House \nManagers Lofgren and Nadler, argued that a purely partisan impeachment \nwould be ``divisive,'' ``lack the legitimacy of a national consensus,'' \nand\n\n\n``call into question the very legitimacy of our political \ninstitutions.''\n  Less than a year ago, Speaker Pelosi said: ``Impeachment is so \ndivisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and \noverwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path \nbecause it divides the country.''\n  Yet here we are. Against the weight of bipartisan consensus and the \nwisdom of the Framers, the House still took this dramatic and \nconsequential step, the first purely partisan impeachment in U.S. \nhistory. Only Democrats in the House voted to impeach the President, \nwhile a bipartisan group of House members opposed.\n  This was done through rushed House proceedings that lacked the most \nbasic due process procedures afforded Presidents Clinton and Nixon \nduring their impeachment investigations. A significant portion of the \nHouse proceedings last fall took place in secret, where the President \nwas not afforded counsel, the ability to call his own witnesses, or \ncross-examine those of the House Democrats. Certain testimonies from \nthese secret hearings were then selectively leaked to a pro-impeachment \npress. This happened in America. In my view, it sounds like something \nmore worthy of the Soviet Union, not the world's greatest \nconstitutional republic.\n  Yet here we are. A new precedent has been set in the House. When \nasked several times if these precedents and the partisan nature of this \nimpeachment should concern us, the House managers dodged the questions, \nand my Senate colleagues, who in 1999 were so strongly and correctly \nand vocally against the dangers of purely partisan impeachments, have \nall gone silent.\n  Perhaps it is too late. Perhaps the genie is now out of the bottle. \nPerhaps the danger that Hamilton so astutely predicted 232 years ago is \nupon us for good. I hope not. No one thinks that partisan impeachments \nevery few years would be good for our great Nation.\n  The Senate does not have to validate this House precedent, and a \nSenate focused on ``deep responsibility to future times'' shouldn't do \nso.\n  In addition to unleashing the danger of purely partisan impeachments, \nthe House's impeachment action and their arguments before the Senate, \nif ratified, have the potential to undermine other critical \nconstitutional norms, such as the separation of powers and the \nindependence of our judiciary.\n  These traditions exist to implement the will of the people we \nrepresent and to protect their liberty. And yet so much of what has \nalready been done in the House and what has now been argued in the \nSenate has little or no precedent in U.S. history, thereby threatening \nmany of the constitutional safeguards that have served our country so \nwell for over two centuries.\n  Take, for example, the debate we recently had on whether to have the \nSenate seek additional evidence for this impeachment trial. The House \nManagers claim that, by not doing so, we are undermining a ``fair \ntrial'' in the Senate. The irony of such a claim should not be lost on \nthe American people.\n  Throughout this trial, and in their briefs, the House managers have \nclaimed dozens of times that they have ``overwhelming evidence'' on the \ncurrent record to impeach the President, thereby undermining their own \nrationale for more evidence.\n  And in terms of fairness, it is well documented that the Democratic \nleadership in the House just conducted the most rushed, partisan, and \nfundamentally unfair House impeachment proceedings in U.S. history.\n  A Senate vote to pursue additional evidence and witnesses would have \nturned the article I constitutional impeachment responsibilities of the \nHouse and Senate on their heads. It would have required the Senate to \ndo the House's impeachment investigatory work, even when the House \naffirmatively declined to seek additional evidence last fall, such as \nsubpoenaing Ambassador John Bolton, because of Speaker Pelosi's \nartificial deadline to impeach the President by Christmas.\n  A vote by the Senate to pursue additional evidence that the House \nconsciously chose not to obtain would incentivize less thorough and \nmore frequent partisan impeachments in the future, a danger that should \nconcern us all.\n  Another example of the House's attempt to erode long-standing \nconstitutional norms is found in its second Article of Impeachment, \nobstruction of Congress. This article claims that the President \ncommitted an impeachable offence by resisting House subpoenas for \nwitnesses and documents, even though the House didn't attempt to \nnegotiate, accommodate, or litigate the President's asserted defenses, \nsuch as executive privilege and immunity, to provide such evidence.\n  These defenses have been utilized by administrations, Democrat and \nRepublican, for decades and go to the heart of the separation of powers \nwithin the article I and article II branches of the Federal Government \nand even implicate a defendant's right to vigorously defend oneself in \ncourt. Indeed, the Supreme Court acknowledged in United States v. Nixon \nthat the President has the right to assert executive privilege.\n  Nevertheless, the House managers argued that the mere assertion of \nthese constitutional rights is an impeachable offense, in essence \nclaiming the unilateral power to define the limits and scope of \nexecutive privilege, while simultaneously usurping that power from the \ncourts, where it has existed for centuries.\n  Indeed, the House managers even argued that merely asserting these \ndefenses is evidence of guilt itself. This is a dangerous argument that \ndemonstrates a lack of understanding of basic constitutional norms. As \nU.S. Supreme Court Justice Brandeis stated in his famous dissent in \nMyers v. United States, ``The doctrine of the separation of powers was \nadopted by the convention of 1787 not to promote efficiency but to \npreclude the exercise of arbitrary power. The purpose was not to avoid \nfriction, but, by means of the inevitable friction incident to the \ndistribution of the governmental powers among three departments, to \nsave the people from autocracy.'' If allowed to stand by the Senate, \nthe implications of these House precedents for our Nation and the \nindividual liberties of the people we represent are difficult to \ndiscern, but would be profound and likely very negative.\n  Similarly concerning were the attempts, both subtle and not so \nsubtle, to inject Chief Justice Roberts of the U.S. Supreme Court into \nthis trial. The smooth siren song of House Manager Schiff, casually \ninviting the Senate and Chief Justice into a constitutional labyrinth \nfor which there may have been no exit, was a recurring theme of this \ntrial.\n  ``We have a perfectly good judge here,'' Schiff said over and over \nagain, ``whom you all trust and have confidence in.'' Let him quickly \ndecide all the weighty legal and constitutional issues before the \nSenate, the relevance of witnesses, claims of immunity and executive \nprivilege, what House Manager Nadler described on day 1 of the trial as \n``executive privilege, and other nonsense.''\n  Moreover, the Chief Justice could do this all within a week, Schiff \ntold us. It all seemed so simple, rational, and efficient. But our \nConstitution doesn't work this way. The Chief Justice, in an \nimpeachment of the President, sits as the Presiding Officer over the \nSenate, not as an article III judge. And while the Senate can delegate \ncertain trial powers to him, it cannot delegate matters, such as a \nPresident's claims of executive privilege, over which the Senate itself \ndoes not have constitutional authority.\n  The quick and efficient fix Schiff was tempting the Senate with might \nhave ended up as a form of constitutional demolition. And as the trial \nproceeded, it became apparent that it was more than just claims of \nefficiency behind the invitation to draw the Chief Justice fully into \nthe trial.\n  There was something else afoot, a subtle and not so subtle attempt by \nsome to attack the credibility and independence of the Chief Justice \nand the Court he leads. The junior Senator from Massachusetts' question \nfor the House managers, which drew an audible gasp from those watching \nin the Senate after the Chief Justice read it, made this clear, when \nshe asked about ``the loss of legitimacy of the Chief Justice, the \nSupreme Court, and the Constitution,'' so too did Minority Leader \nSchumer's parliamentary inquiry about the precedent from the \nimpeachment of President Johnson 150 years ago, on the role of the \nChief Justice in breaking ties on 50-50 votes in\n\n\nthe Senate during Presidential impeachments. Chief Justice Roberts' \ncogent, historically accurate, and constitutionally, based answer to \nthis inquiry will set an important precedent on this impeachment issue \nfor generations to come.\n  Perhaps it is all a coincidence, but as these attempts to diminish \nthe Chief Justice's credibility by more fully dragging him into this \nimpeachment trial were ongoing, much more harsh political ads directly \nattacking him in this regard were being launched across the country. \nMembers of the Senate noticed, and we were not impressed.\n  The independence of the Federal judiciary as established in our \nConstitution is a gift to our Nation that has taken centuries to \ndevelop. The overreach of the House managers and certain Democratic \nSenators seeking to undermine this essential constitutional norm was a \ndisappointing and even dangerous aspect of this impeachment trial.\n  When historians someday write about this divisive period of American \nhistory, they would do well to focus on these subtle and not so subtle \nattacks on the Chief Justice's credibility--and by extension the \ncredibility of the Supreme Court--for it was clearly one of the \nimportant reasons why the Senate voted last week, 51 to 49, to no \nlonger prolong the trial phase of this impeachment.\n  The impeachment articles do not charge the President with a crime. \nAlthough there was much debate in the trial on whether this is \nrequired, it is undisputed that in all previous presidential \nimpeachments--Johnson, Nixon, and Clinton--the President was charged \nwith having violated a criminal statute. And there was little dispute \nthat these charges were accurate. Lowering the bar to non-criminal \noffenses has set a new precedent. However, whether a crime is required \nis still debatable. Instead, the House impeachment charged the \nPresident with an abuse of power based on speculative interpretation of \nhis intent.\n  So what about the President's actions that were the primary focus of \nthis impeachment trial and the basis of the House's first Article of \nImpeachment claim that he abused his power? The House managers argued \nthat the President abused his power by taking actions that on their \nface appeared valid--withholding aid to a foreign country and \ninvestigating corruption--but were motivated by ``corrupt intent.''\n  One significant problem with this argument is that it is vague and \nhinges on deciphering the President's intent and motives, a difficult \nfeat because it is subjective and could be--and was indeed in this \ncase--defined by a partisan House. Further, the House managers argue \nessentially that there could be no legitimate national interest in \npursuing investigations into interference of the U.S. 2016 elections by \nUkraine and corruption involving Burisma.\n  I believe all Presidents have the right to investigate interference \nin U.S. elections and credible claims of corruption and conflicts of \ninterest, particularly in countries where America sends significant \namounts of foreign aid, like Ukraine, and where corruption is endemic, \nlike Ukraine.\n  Were the President's actions perfect? No. For example, despite having \nthe authority to investigate corruption in Ukraine and with Burisma, I \nbelieve he should have requested such an investigation through more \nofficial and robust channels, such as pursuing cooperation through the \nU.S. Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with Ukraine, with the Department \nof Justice in the lead. I also believe that the role of Mr. Giuliani \nhas caused confusion and may have undermined the Trump administration's \nbroader foreign policy goals with regard to Ukraine.\n  But none of this even remotely rises to the level of an offense that \nmerits removing the President from office. It is difficult to imagine a \nsituation requiring a higher burden of proof. The radical and dangerous \nstep that the House Democrats are proposing seems to have been lost in \nall of the noise.\n  What they are asking the Senate to do is not just overturn the \nresults of the 2016 election--nullifying the votes of millions of \nAmericans--but to remove the President from the 2020 ballot, even as \nprimary voting has begun across the country.\n  Such a step, if ever realized, would do infinitely more damage to the \nlegitimacy of our constitutional republic and political system than any \nmistake or error of judgment President Trump may have made.\n  An impeachment trial is supposed to be the last resort to protect the \nAmerican people against the highest crimes that undermine and threaten \nthe foundations of our Republic, not to get rid of a President because \na faction of one political party disagrees with the way he governs. \nThat is what elections are for.\n  I trust the Alaskan and American people, not House Democrats, with \nthe monumental decision of choosing who should lead our Nation.\n  And soon, they will decide, again, who should lead our Nation. In \nchurches, libraries, and school cafeterias, the people all across the \ncountry will vote for who they want to represent them.\n  And I am convinced that the American people will make their choices \nwisely.\n  Let me conclude by saying a few words about where we should go from \nhere.\n  Right before this impeachment trial began, I was at an event in \nWasilla, AK, where many of Alaska's military veterans attended. A proud \nveteran approached me with a simple but fervent request. ``Senator \nSullivan,'' he said, ``Protect our Constitution.''\n  So many of us, including me, have heard similar pleas over the past \nfew months from the people we represent, but there was something about \nthe way he said it, something in his eyes that truly got my attention. \nI realized that something was fear. That man, a brave Alaskan who had \nserved in the military to protect our constitutional freedoms, was \nafraid that the country he knows and he loves was at risk. And I have \nto admit that I have had similar fears these past weeks.\n  But I look around me, on this floor, and I continue to see hope for \nour Nation.\n  I see my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--my friends--who \nare willing to work with me on so many issues to find solutions sorely \nneeded for the country.\n  And back home, I see my fellow Alaskans, some of them fearful, but \nalso so hungry to do their part to help heal the divides.\n  We should end this chapter, and we should take our cues from them, \nthe people whose spirit and character guides this great Nation. They \nwant us to protect our Constitution. They need us to work together to \ndo that and address America's challenges.\n  It's time to get back to the work Alaskans want the Congress to focus \non: growing our economy, improving our infrastructure, rebuilding our \nmilitary, cleaning up our oceans, lowering healthcare costs and drug \nprices, opening markets for our fishermen, and taking care of our most \nvulnerable in society like survivors of sexual assault and domestic \nviolence and those struggling with addiction.\n  That is what I am committed to do.", "turn": 81, "speaker_bioguide": "S001198", "itemno": 104}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "Ms. CORTEZ MASTO", "text": "  Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, the decision I make today is not an \neasy one, nor should it be.\n  I have approached this serious task with an open and impartial mind, \nas my trial oath required. I have studied the facts and the evidence of \nthe case before me.\n  I have been an attorney for over two decades, and I was the attorney \ngeneral of Nevada for 8 years. And I keep coming back to what I learned \nin the courtroom. The law is a technical field, but it is also based on \ncommon sense.\n  You don't have to study the law for years to know that stealing and \ncheating are wrong. It is one of the first things we learn in our \nformative years.\n  And you don't have to be a law school professor to realize that a \nPresident should not be using the job the American people gave him to \nbenefit himself personally.\n  Abraham Lincoln reminded us that our Nation was founded on the \nessential idea of government ``of the people, by the people, for the \npeople.''\n  As I sat on the Senate floor thinking about President Lincoln and \nlistening to the arguments in President Trump's impeachment trial, I \nthought of the awesome responsibility our Founding Fathers entrusted to \neach Senator.\n  I also thought about all of the Nevadans I represent--those who voted \nfor President Trump and those who did not. For those who did, I put \nmyself in\n\n\ntheir shoes and considered how I would respond if the President were \nfrom my political party.\n  The removal of a sitting President through impeachment is an \nextraordinary remedy. It rarely occurs, and no Senator should rush into \nit.\n  Yet impeachment is a key part of our constitutional order. When our \nFounding Fathers designed the Office of the Presidency, the Framers of \nthe Constitution had just gotten rid of a King, and they didn't want \nanother one.\n  They were afraid that the President might use his extensive powers \nfor his own benefit.\n  To prevent this, the Framers provided for impeachment by the House \nand trial by the Senate for ``treason, bribery, or other high crimes \nand misdemeanors.''\n  They didn't have to do things this way. They could have left it up to \nthe courts to hold the trial of a President accused of wrongdoing.\n  But they wanted to make sure each branch of government could be a \ncheck on the other, which would bring balance to our system of \ngovernment.\n  And the Framers were specifically concerned with the idea of an all-\npowerful Executive who might abuse his power and invite foreign \ninterference in our elections.\n  This concern is reflected in the Articles of Impeachment laid out by \nthe House managers.\n  Putting aside the biases I heard coming from both political parties, \nI focused on getting to the truth of the case--like any trial attorney.\n  The truth in any case that I have been involved with starts with the \nfacts.\n  For 2 weeks I listened to the arguments presented by both sides, took \nnotes, posed questions, and identified the facts that were supported \nand substantiated and those that were not.\n  With a heavy heart and great sadness, I became convinced by the \nevidence that President Trump intentionally withheld security \nassistance and a coveted White House meeting to pressure Ukraine into \nhelping him politically, even though Ukraine was defending itself from \nRussia.\n  This wasn't an action ``of the people, by the people, for the \npeople.''\n  President Trump used the immense power of the U.S. Government not for \nthe people but, rather, for himself.\n  We know these facts from President Trump's own words in a phone call \nto Ukrainian President Zelensky in July and in statements to the press \nin October.\n  We also know it through the testimony of 17 American officials--many \nof them appointed by the President himself.\n  Those officials indicated that over the spring and summer of 2019, \nthrough both his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and through American \ndiplomats, President Trump asked Ukraine to publicly announce \ninvestigations that would influence the 2020 elections in his favor.\n  We also know through testimony provided during the House \ninvestigation that President Trump tried to pressure Ukraine to \nannounce those investigations, first by conditioning a visit by \nPresident Zelensky to the White House on them and later by denying $391 \nmillion in security assistance to Ukraine.\n  Some of my colleagues don't dispute these facts.\n  President Trump's actions interfere with the fundamental tenets of \nour Constitution. Citizens do not get to govern themselves if the \nofficials who get elected seek their own benefit to the detriment of \nthe public good.\n  The Framers knew this. They were very aware that officials could \nleverage their office to benefit themselves.\n  In Federalist No. 65, Alexander Hamilton explained why we had the \nimpeachment power in the first place: it was to respond to ``those \noffenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or in other \nwords, from the abuse or violation of some public trust.''\n  With the undisputed facts condemning the president, I listened to the \nPresident's counsel argue that the Articles of Impeachment were \ndefective because abuse of power and obstruction of Congress are not \ncrimes.\n  However, many constitutional scholars soundly refuted this argument, \nand precedent supports them. The Impeachment Articles in President \nNixon's case included abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.\n  During this impeachment investigation, the President blocked all \nmembers of his administration from testifying in response to \ncongressional committee requests and withheld all documents.\n  This action is absolutely unprecedented in American history. Even \nPresidents Nixon and Clinton allowed staff to testify to Congress \nduring impeachment investigations and provided some documents.\n  The executive branch has no blanket claim to secrecy. It works for \nthe American people, as do Members of Congress.\n  In the Senate, the President's counsel argued that the House \ninvestigators should have fought this wholesale obstruction in court. \nYet at the same time, in a court down the street, other administration \nlawyers contended that the courts should stay out of disputes between \nCongress and the President.\n  The President's counsel also argued that the American people should \ndecide in the next election whether to remove President Trump for his \nactions. But if this were the standard, then the impeachment clause \ncould only ever be utilized in the second term of a Presidency, when no \nupcoming election would preserve the country.\n  Most importantly, isn't the impeachment clause pointless if a \npresident can abuse his power in office and then completely refuse to \ncomply with a House impeachment investigation and a Senate trial in \norder to delay until the next election?\n  The Framers themselves actually argued about whether Americans could \nrely on elections to get rid of bad presidents. They decided that if \nthey didn't put the impeachment power into the Constitution, a corrupt \nPresident would be willing to do anything to get himself reelected.\n  James Madison said that without impeachment, a corrupt President \n``might be fatal to the Republic.''\n  And through my oath of office as a Senator, I swore to protect not \njust Nevadans but also our great Republic.\n  Our country, unfortunately, has never been more divided along party \nlines. It played out in the House impeachment investigation and in the \nSenate trial. The Senate rules for the trial were not written by all of \nthe Senators with bipartisan input. Instead, they were written behind \nclosed doors by one man in coordination with the President. In so \ndoing, the Senate has abdicated its powerful check on the executive \nbranch.\n  Without this important check, I am concerned about what the President \nwill do next to put our Republic in jeopardy.\n  We have seen that President Trump is willing to violate our \nConstitution in order to get himself reelected. He has disrespected \nnorms and worked to divide our country for his own political gain. He \nhas undermined our standing in the world and put awesome pressure on \nforeign leaders to benefit himself, rather than to advance the \ninterests of our country.\n  I have also learned from this trial that the President is willing to \ntake any action, including cheating in the next election, to serve his \npersonal interest.\n  No act in our country is more sacred and solemn for democracy than \nvoting, and nothing in our system of government is more vital to the \ncontinued health of our democracy than its elections. No American \nshould stand for foreign election interference, much less invite it.\n  American elections are for Americans.\n  That is why I cannot condone this President's actions by acquitting \nhim.\n  Finding the President guilty of abuse of power and obstruction of \nCongress marks a sad day for our country and not something I do with a \nlight heart.\n  But I was sent to Congress not just to fight for all Nevadans but \nalso to fight for our children and their future. To leave them with a \ncountry that still believes in right and wrong, that exposes corruption \nin government and holds it accountable, that stands up to tyranny at \nhome and abroad.\n  In my view, President Trump has fallen far, far short of those lofty \nideals and of the demands of our Constitution.\n  That requires the rest of us, regardless of party, creed, or \nethnicity, to work together all the more urgently to defend our \ndemocracy, our elections, and our national security.\n\n\n  I have faith in Americans because I have seen time and time again in \nNevada our ability to come together and work with one another for our \ncommon good.\n  America is more than just one person, and like President Lincoln's, \nmy faith will always lie with the people.", "turn": 82, "speaker_bioguide": "C001113", "itemno": 105}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker": "Ms. ROSEN", "text": "  Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I didn't come to the Senate expecting to \nsit as a juror in an impeachment trial. I have participated in this \ntrial with an open mind, determined to evaluate the President's actions \noutside of any partisan lens, and with a focus on my constitutional \nobligations. I listened to the arguments, took detailed notes, asked \nquestions, and heard both sides answer questions from my colleagues. \nAfter thorough consideration, based on the evidence presented, sadly, I \nfind I have no choice but to vote to remove the President from office.\n  The first Article of Impeachment charges the President with abuse of \npower, specifically alleging that the President used the powers of his \npublic office to obtain an improper political benefit. I can now \nconclude the evidence shows that this is exactly what the President did \nwhen he withheld critically important security assistance from Ukraine \nin order to persuade the Ukrainian Government to investigate his \npolitical rival. I understand that foreign policy involves \nnegotiations, leveraging advantages, and using all the powers at our \ndisposal to advance U.S. national security goals. But this was \ndifferent. The President sent his personal attorney, whose obligation \nis to protect the personal interests of the President, not the United \nStates, to meet and negotiate with foreign government officials from \nUkraine to get damaging information about the President's rivals, \nculminating in the July 25 phone call between the U.S. and Ukrainian \nPresidents, during which the President made clear his intent to \nwithhold aid until a political favor was completed. In doing so, the \nPresident put U.S. national security and a key alliance against Russian \naggression at risk, all so he could benefit politically from the \npotential fallout from an investigation into a possible opponent.\n  While I would like to hear more from witnesses and see the documents \nthe administration is withholding, the evidence presented is compelling \nand not in doubt. The President withheld military aid in order to \ncoerce an ally to help him politically. This is no mere policy \ndisagreement; this is about whether the President negotiates with \nforeign governments on behalf of the United States; or on his own \nbehalf. No elected official, regardless of party, should use public \noffice to advance his or her personal interests, particularly to the \ndetriment of U.S. national security, and in the case of the President \nof the United States, such conduct is particularly dangerous. As \nelected officials, we have no more important responsibility than \nensuring our national security, and that includes protecting the Nation \nfrom future threats. The President's conduct here sets a dangerous \nprecedent that must not be repeated in the future and requires a firm \nresponse by the representatives of the people. After hearing evidence \nthat the President heldup congressionally approved military assistance \nto an ally fighting Russia in order to exact concessions from Ukraine \nthat benefited him personally, we cannot trust the President to place \nnational security over his own interests. It is therefore with sadness \nthat I conclude that the President must be removed from office under \narticle I and I will vote to convict him of abuse of power.\n  With respect to the second Article of Impeachment charging \nobstruction of Congress, the President's behavior suggests that he \nbelieves he is above the law. Certainly, there may be documents and \ntestimony that are subject to executive privilege or are confidential \nfor some other reason. But here, the President directed every agency, \noffice, and employee in the executive branch not to cooperate with the \nimpeachment inquiry conducted by the U.S. House of Representatives. As \na Member of Congress, I take my oversight role seriously. It is how we \nensure transparency in government, so the people of Nevada can know how \ntheir tax dollars are spent and whether their elected officials are \nacting legally, ethically, and in their best interests. The President's \nrefusal to negotiate in good faith with the House investigators over \ndocuments and testimony and instead to impede any investigation into \nhis official conduct can only be characterized as blatant obstruction.\n  More importantly, it suggests that he will continue to operate \noutside the law, and if he believes he can ignore lawful subpoenas from \nCongress, it will be impossible to hold him accountable. For these \nreasons, I will vote to convict the President of obstruction of \nCongress, as delineated in article II.\n  Impeachment is a grave constitutional remedy, not a partisan \nexercise. To fulfill my constitutional role as a juror, I asked myself \nhow I would view the evidence if it were any President accused of this \nconduct. Based on the facts and arguments presented, I conclude that no \nPresident of the United States, regardless of party, can trade \ncongressionally approved and legally mandated military assistance for \npersonal political favors. No one is above the law, not this President \nor the next President. Having exercised my constitutional duty, I will \ncontinue what I have been doing over the course of this trial and have \ndone since I first came to Congress, to look past partisanship and \ndevelop commonsense, bipartisan solutions that help hard-working \nfamilies in Nevada and across the country.\n", "turn": 83, "speaker_bioguide": "R000608", "itemno": 106}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker": "None", "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 107}], "related_bills": [{"congress": "116", "context": "OTHER", "number": "660", "type": "HRES"}, {"congress": "116", "context": "OTHER", "number": "755", "type": "HRES"}, {"congress": "116", "context": "OTHER", "number": "1031", "type": "HRES"}], "related_usc": [{"title": "18", "detail": "(a)(3)", "number": "201"}, {"title": "18", "detail": "(b)", "number": "201"}, {"title": "18", "detail": "(c)", "number": "201"}, {"title": "22", "detail": "(a)", "number": "2311"}, {"title": "22", "number": "2754"}], "id": "CREC-2020-02-05-pt1-PgS873", "doc_title": "IMPEACHMENT", "title": "IMPEACHMENT"}
