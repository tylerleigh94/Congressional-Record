Mr. Speaker, I would like to honor Chief Daniel Spiegel \non his retirement from the Wildwood Fire Department.\n  Daniel spent 28 faithful years with the fire department, where he had \nserved as chief since 2016. Daniel has the distinct honor of holding \nevery rank in the fire department. Daniel's father also served as fire \nchief in Wildwood, the second-ever father-son chief in the department's \nhistory.\n  Daniel served in the New Jersey Task Force 1 Urban Research and \nRescue and responded to the September 11 terrorist attacks, searching \nfor survivors. He was the team leader for the Cape May County Regional \nUrban Search and Rescue Team, which serves all of Cape May County.\n  Danny was always focused on training. He trained thousands of \nfirefighters in our entire region.\n  He is planning to spend more time with his wife, daughter, and two \nstepsons in retirement.\n  I thank Daniel for his service; his community thanks him for his \nservice; and his country thanks him for his service.\n  Daniel, may God bless you. You are truly one of our heroes.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker_bioguide": "V000133", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker": "None", "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 2}], "id": "CREC-2020-02-05-pt1-PgH839", "doc_title": "HONORING CHIEF DANIEL SPIEGEL", "title": "HONORING CHIEF DANIEL SPIEGEL"}
