Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Sheriff Ronnie \nSprinkle, who began his service as the sheriff of Botetourt County \nnearly two decades ago. When Ronnie was just 6 months, his father was \nelected as Botetourt County sheriff and held the position for 30 years, \nretiring in 1991. Eight years later, the junior Sprinkle followed in \nhis dad's footsteps and was elected to the same post, which he held \nuntil retirement last month.\n  Save the 8 years between his father's retirement and Ronnie's \nelection, 2020 will mark the first time since the heart of the Vietnam \nwar that a Sprinkle has not led the Botetourt Sheriff's Office.\n  I want to thank Sheriff Ronnie for his years of service to our \ncommunity and congratulate him on all he has accomplished during his \ntenure. His tireless work to secure funding for a new public safety \nbuilding and jail will not be forgotten.\n  The risks and responsibilities that come with being a law enforcement \nofficer are many, and I want to express my sincere gratitude to Ronnie \nSprinkle for his unwavering commitment to Botetourt County and all our \nmen and women in blue.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker_bioguide": "C001118", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker": "None", "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 2}], "id": "CREC-2020-02-05-pt1-PgH838-4", "doc_title": "HONORING RONNIE SPRINKLE", "title": "HONORING RONNIE SPRINKLE"}
