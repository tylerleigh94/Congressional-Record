Madam Speaker, it pains me to stand before you today and \nrecognize Gun Violence Survivors Week. As a Nation, we grieve for all \nthe lives lost senselessly and all those who must live in the wake of \nthese acts of horror.\n  This week alone, we have seen another school devastated by gun \nviolence, another community uncertain how to move forward.\n  Our country is faced with a growing epidemic, and it is our \nresponsibility as lawmakers to take action to protect our communities.\n\n\n  That is why I am proud to have joined Senator Elizabeth Warren, \nCongressman Hank Johnson, and a group of colleagues to introduce the \nGun Violence Prevention and Community Safety Act.\n  This bold reform includes my bill to strengthen gun shop regulations \nand prevent the theft of legal firearms. Over 30 percent of guns used \nin a crime are identified as stolen, and every one we keep out of the \nhands of the wrong people is a step closer to a safer reality for our \nNation. The time to act is now.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker_bioguide": "M001206", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker": "None", "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker_bioguide": null, "itemno": 2}], "id": "CREC-2020-02-05-pt1-PgH774-9", "doc_title": "GUN VIOLENCE SURVIVORS WEEK", "title": "GUN VIOLENCE SURVIVORS WEEK"}
